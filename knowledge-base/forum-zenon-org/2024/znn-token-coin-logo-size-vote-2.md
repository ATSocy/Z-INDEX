The community has selected the ["Coin" logo](https://forum2.zenon.org/t/znn-token-logo-vote/680/12).  Final vote is to select the size.  Don't be confused with the name. Smol "logos" can be effective too if you know how to use it.  Which size (logo below) do you like the most.  This selection will be finalized and submitted to Trustwallet and PCS.  And thanks again to @mr.ztark for drumming up these options.

Looks like the community has selected the Medium version.  I will prepare an A Z submission to submit the token logo to Trustwallet!
