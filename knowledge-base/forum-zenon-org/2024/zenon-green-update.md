Greetings, distinguished degens,

I offer to the community, a blessed and renewed "Zenon Green" that commemorates Zenon's inception, which occurred on 2019-03-21. 

The color code #19e321

Enjoy.

Love,
Stark

I'm planning on integrating these colors in syrius 0.2.0. What should be the official ZTS color? Currently syrius defines #F91690

Here's a comparison shot between old and new colors.

#19e321 with white text is hard on the eyes.

#F91690 is better there, for that ux.

The second one looks good

Both are actually, but #19e321 a bit more so.

I like the brighter color for initial high impact or a one-time experience. But the milder tone is better for ongoing and repeat usage.

Others agree, we'll leave the colors as they are.

I agree, the more mute colors from the old version look better for syrius.

the colors for the uniswap mobile wallet and the overall interface is really good - could use some inspiration from there if you're looking for a reference
