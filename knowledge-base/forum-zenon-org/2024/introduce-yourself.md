Thought it would be good for anyone with developer or IT experience to post your skillset here. It will be useful for when we start putting together teams for development.

Romeo:
15+ years ICT consulting experience. No Dev experience but skilled in Microsoft, VMware and Citrix technologies and pretty much the full infrastructure stack.

Got a degree in IT and have been a fullstack developer for around 6 years now. I am more into making small projects and just having fun all around. I've the following skillset: 
- HTML/CSS/Javascript/Jquery/Nodejs
- PHP
- Coldfusion / Java
- Python
- C sharp
- Photoshop / Premiere / Unity / Blender / FLstudio
- SQL databases
- Continuing on old projects
- Coming up with ideas

I wont say I am a "good" programmer because I don't care about making clean ultra organized projects. So I am probably not suited for core related NoM contributions. Also I have almost no knowledge on blockchains / smart contract etc. because I really don't care about the financial side. 

If you have any fun secondary projects you need help on then perhaps I can be of service. Already have got a couple of cool zenon related projects but prob too much work for free.

I'm a Real Estate Developer in the real world w/ > 30 years of experience.  I have absolutely no IT "experience" but I'm really fucking good at google.  I run an ISP on the side, I taught myself to code in python, I have a large IT infrastructure w/ HA setups in vmware and others, I manage several SANs for work, I ran my first BBS on a 300 baud modem when compuserve was around.  I've setup probably 100 forums over the years, and I'm good at SEO.  I taught myself everything with google and I'm a good problem solver.  But don't count on me to code anything for a production envt.  

I did once go down the scrapy rabbit hole and got really good with it.  I setup a mechanical turk to circumvent CAPTCHA and pulled a  6m line database with great data for my business.

great start, anyone else want to add? We can eventually turn this into a Wiki post on the forum that can serve as a catalogue of community members and their skillsets for future proposals

I've been doing mostly backend-stuff for 5+ years. Strong background in Algorithms & such. Really into stonks & finance. In the last 3 years I've started taking an interest in the crypto space, learning about different protocols & such, mostly because of the algorithms behind and moon possibility ðŸš€

* JavaScript / TypeScript / NodeJS
* C++ / Go 
* Solidity
* can learn pretty much anything

At the moment, I work on a DeFi project as a full time job. Learned Solidity & GO on the job and would like to extend that knowledge to the best of my ability on the ZNN project.
