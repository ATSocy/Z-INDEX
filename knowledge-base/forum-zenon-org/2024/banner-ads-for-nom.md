@John-Z did you ever purchase the Banner Ads for NoM?

I did, here is the receipt for buying their services. I indeed decided to not post them yet as I didn't consider it to be the best timing, but in the next weeks we will have the article up on their site.

Hi John!

It has been a while ago since we've had an update from you regrading the campaign! is the ad still valid for use?

Would love to hear back from you!

It would be great to wait on releasing paid advertising until the bridge is live, the mobile wallet is live, we update syrius, and activate the most recent spork.
