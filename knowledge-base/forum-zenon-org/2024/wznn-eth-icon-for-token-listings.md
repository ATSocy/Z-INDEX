Thread: wznn-eth-icon-for-token-listings
mehowbrainz | 2024-03-27 15:19:52 UTC | #1

@sol is working on getting wZNN.ETH added to [THORNode's token list](https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/blob/develop/common/tokenlist/ethtokens/eth_mainnet_V117.json) so that it can be swapped cross-chain in their interfaces.

In the past the community had agreed on this ZNN token icon: https://forum2.zenon.org/t/a-z-proposal-to-submit-the-znn-token-logo-to-trust-wallet-asset-repo/742

And I presented a new lineup for wZNN.ETH:

Apologies for mucking up your poll, but I've had this in mind.

Is that a blue from Ethereum's brand colours?

I think there's a tad too much going on there, outline + gradient -- 2 cents

It seems like ETH uses a range of colors at this point, so I just went by feel and in relation to Zenon green and the old wznn PCS logo. Gradients certainly do have their disadvantages but I don't think we'll be doing letterhead, embroidery, etc with this logo. I followed the motif of the PCS wZNN logo.

Not a big deal to me either way. Simply putting forth my best. If there is some consensus for variations on this, I can do it. If not, less work for me.

Agree. Simplicity is key. Also, outlines are so 90s

Agree.  Gradients feel a little dated IMO.

I like the ETH brand color idea as being protagonist like in 4-7. However, I think using something similar to:

https://forum2.zenon.org/t/syrius-icon-redesign/1523/15

works better because having ZNN written horizontally instead of using the main vertical ZN logo already is a great differentiator for wZNN.

I really like [#19e321](https://forum2.zenon.org/t/zenon-green-update/1677)

Can we submit this one instead?

We should probably unify our branding decision.

I'm still vouching for a different icon for the wrapped version of the assets. It makes sense. They are different.

-------------------------

kw1da1 | 2023-11-25 21:13:32 UTC | #12

The wrapped token should be white with green Znn imo, a little nod to an away jersey lol

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2023-11-25 21:15:27 UTC | #13

maybe we should try this to see how it looks.

-------------------------

NeoShredder | 2023-11-26 12:50:02 UTC | #14

Do we need a seperate icon for wZNN? 
It might confuse new guys unnecessarily
