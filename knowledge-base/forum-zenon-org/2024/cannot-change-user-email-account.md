@mehowbrainz  I'm trying to update my email address on the forum.  I receive the following message.  When I click the link to approve it, I get a message that says "Oops! That page doesnâ€™t exist or is private."

I also wanted to point out I'm getting a warning on the sending domain below.

Here is the [Learn More link](https://proton.me/support/email-has-failed-its-domains-authentication-requirements-warning).

We should probably look into this.

thx
