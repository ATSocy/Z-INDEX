BTC machines are doing a Twitter space this Friday and they invited ZNN. I can probably get one of us on stage to talk about Zénon Network and Ordinals + anything. Any volunteers? If nobody is up I'll do it myself.

With Zenon Virtual Machines becoming a real thing, I wonder if there is an opportunity to discuss with BTC Machines?

Perhaps they would like to launch their own extension chain. The feeless base layer of NoM enables them maximum flexibility in designing their economy.
