Thread: community-marketing-initiative
aliencoder | 2023-06-23 17:07:09 UTC | #1

I'm starting this thread to kickstart a community marketing campaign for Zenon.

We need good exposure in order to get more people interested in Zenon and attract new developers.

Let's discuss strategies, funnels and marketing related stuff.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2023-06-23 17:55:13 UTC | #2

My recommendation to get started:

Campaign type: Community-led AMA's
Audience: Gem Hunters / Infra Operators
Platforms: Telegram Groups  / Discord / Twitter Spaces / Facebook Groups / Live Twitter Threads / Binance Live

Requirements:

* Build a squad of AMA coordinators + writers/speakers (if live via voice).
* Aggregate in the forums a public list of such groups that fit the above profile.
* Develop a cold reach out approach i.e. how do you introduce Zenon to the group + ask for an AMA?
* Develop an incentive for the group to participate. A giveaway of some ZNN/QSR funded via AZ? Could force AMA participants to receive their first ZNN/QSR + be asked to run an embedded node via SYRIUS. The goal is to have them experience the ease of syrius + speed of the network.
* Shill the various roles available: delegator, staked, LP, pillar etc.
* Transcribe the AMA's to be reposted as Twitter threads in the outbound to promote both the participating channel/group, and the AMA. We can promise RT's from ZenonOrg + other community handles.
* If you want to track performance + prove value drive, make an [Attribute](https://attribute.zenon.org/link-builder) link for every AMA (when sharing zenon.org links). Though please advise users that the market for Zenon is no longer Stex + BSC. We're going to release the new Zenon.Org shortly (currently can't update the site, an issue with the host will break the website hence why I'm rushing to replace it with the new codebase+ infrastructure).
* The participating channel/group should work with the campaigner for added exposure of the scheduled AMA event (RT's / hype building etc).
* Important: Should AMA campaigners be paid via AZ for their contributions? IMO yes. Any alien can take such campaign model and develop an AZ proposal.

With the upcoming [funnel framework](https://forum2.zenon.org/t/landing-page-funnel-framework/1494/3), we'll be able to push users down a path to install syrius, connect to syrius with WC, engage in some way + measure conversions using Attribute links.

I originally found THORChain RUNE when I was participating in such groups in 2019. We'd get an AMA done + pool as a community to get an allocation of early RUNE tokens. Got a bunch of $0.01 RUNE, which then lead me to buy more + stake.

Ideally these campaigns are started once we can buy/sell wZNN.ETH

Script when starting the AMA:

**INTRODUCTION**

Hello everyone! We're excited to be here. We're the community behind Zenon.Network, the self-evolving network globally deployed to shape digital economies of scale, powered by a worldwide community of innovators​. We're here to share more about our project and answer any questions you have.

**OVERVIEW**

Zenon.Network is a decentralized, hyper-scalable global network based on a novel dual-ledger architecture. We're driven by the ethos and principles of Bitcoin and we're overcoming the current limitations of legacy blockchain systems through our unique architecture that can asynchronously process orders of magnitude more transactions​. Please take a moment to watch this video:

https://youtu.be/UqAequz4mgk

**ZNN & QSR**

Our dual-coin economy is based on Zenon (ZNN) and Quasar (QSR), which work in synergy to power the ultimate protocol for creating digital value.

**REWARDS SYSTEM**

As a participant in our network, you can get daily rewards. The NoM offers attractive annual percentage yields (APY) for Delegators, Sentinels, Stakers, Pillars, LP's.

**SYRIUS WALLET**

We've also developed Syrius, a state-of-the-art non-custodial wallet for the Network of Momentum. With Syrius, you can store and manage your ZNN, QSR, and ZTS tokens in a cross-platform, user-friendly, and safe digital wallet​. It features an embedded more, and is continuously maintained/updated by our community of builders.

**SDKs & DEVELOPMENT**

For developers, we offer a variety of SDKs written in the most popular programming languages. This allows you to interact with the Network of Momentum and build the future, today​.

**ACCELERATOR-Z & FUNDING**

Our Accelerator-Z is a DAO of DAOs with a protocol level treasury called Zenon Fabric, managed to fund ongoing operations, research & development, and new products and services to expand the ecosystem​. Anyone can submit a proposal on-chain.

**COMMUNITY**

We are proud of our welcoming community of entrepreneurs, builders, and innovators at the forefront of distributed ledger technology and Web3. We invite you to join us and be part of this exciting journey.

**QUESTIONS**

We're open to questions now. Whether you're curious about our technology, how to get involved, or anything else, feel free to ask!

-------------------

GPT4 wrote all of that. I asked it:

> We're Zenon.Network, a crypto project looking to organize AMA's. We'll likely find telegram, discord, facebook groups to participate-with for cross-promotion of the project. Can you give me an AMA script which contextualizes Zenon.Network?

it's missing the incentive, but that's something the community will have to agree-to, and Pillars to vote-on IMO. They need to see a thorough proposal first!

Amazing, makes it very easy for folks to start sharing more widely.  

Have found personally as well that [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) is a great way to passively get eyeballs and still allow people to engage async for the AMA format by just dropping it in the groups you're referring to.  This could go well for pieces like "The most robust L1 wallet in the market" or a deck walkthrough that @cryptocheshire or literally this script above word for word.

Now that we have WalletConnect, we can do it without any Syrius integrations. We only need a nice web app. I think it will attract new people.

Separate note:  Here are the Layer 1 analysts at Messari.  Been trying to DM a few of them to no avail yet.  I think community tagging of these folks might get it on their radar.  The downstream effects of getting a Messari deep-dive is huge.

@sumamu @mehowbrainz @dat_she_pepe @angelo_a_jr @0x3639 let's see if we can list `wZNN` to increase visibility

-------------------------

angelo_a_jr | 2023-06-28 17:14:27 UTC | #37

Submitted for wZNN and wQSR Sushiswap.  Volume doesn't bode super well for the listing.  Looks like it automatically pulls data from CoinGecko:

https://github.com/sushiswap/list/pull/1061#issue-1778905679
https://github.com/sushiswap/list/pull/1062


UPDATES:

-Cryptorank update request also in for wZNN; wQSR not started
-1inch form submitted for wZNN; wQSR needs $200K liquidity
-Embr submitted for wZNN & wQSR

-Several others require some e-mail contact.  Was going to setup a community account on proton mail if we don't have one already that can be used by marketing/BD teams.  But would be good to use the custom domain such as zenon.network or zenon.org.  @mehowbrainz do you have access to these?

Who is doing marketing for Zenon now?

We need a marketing campaign from A to Z:

- Twitter engagement: verified accounts with sponsored posts and threads with interesting information
- Reddit engagement: AMAs, posts and threads about current and future developments
- Web3 campaigns: QuestN is promising and can bring users
- Discord engagement
- Presence on other social media networks for example TikTok and Instagram (focused on hype/ alien theme)

Without a clear marketing campaign and an aligned community effort, we won't be able to gain adoption.

Everyone compains about the price, but no one wants to do what is mandatory to bring more buyers.

Our objective should be at least $10 until September.

A community team for this initiative must be formed. Who's in? I'm prioritizing the relaunch of the zenon.org under the new codebase so that we have updated content, without its release I can't update the current site. I'm not free to campaign at the moment, community has to take charge here.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-07-02 15:20:13 UTC | #42

The best campaign would be a good PA and a good PA would come with a good campaign. How to? The thing would be to reach outside of the Zenon little bubble. The market is not really receptive to slamming imo. Some people brought up the idea of being visible on Messari or others serious platform so we get the right people in. Having a real difference VS others L1 could help. Right now our base layer is unfinished and therefore hard to market thought.

Twitter spaces with other communities would help. I can reach out to some Ordinals projects or even L1. But we need a leverage for bringing big guys on such events. 

EDIT: somewhere in July Scirockoe and myself would love to do a space with let's say BTC Machines about NFTs, Ordinals and ZNN.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2023-07-02 16:22:00 UTC | #43

I would love to have someone with sales experience to steer the narrative. While it is true that our base L1 is in an unfinished state, what needs to be done is highlight its benefits: 5 years of decentralization, dual-economy that addresses PoS limitations, the audacity of founding devs to maintain the L1 as lean as possible while anticipating a layered scaling approach (proven right by the recent boom of Layer-2's), etc...

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-07-02 16:31:22 UTC | #44

Sales experience in web2 is absolutely meaningless in crypto though.

-------------------------

angelo_a_jr | 2023-07-02 16:41:08 UTC | #45

This is a great point and probably warrants its own forum thread for Zenon Business Development which is a distinct strategy from pure play marketing.

Getting in front of promising new projects/DAOs, etc. who are still undecided on which chain to build on for example would bake in the marketing and distribution for Zenon/NoM already.

[quote="dat_she_pepe, post:44, topic:1520, full:true"]
Sales experience in web2 is absolutely meaningless in crypto though.
[/quote]

This is also entirely incorrect.  Underlying sales principles are pretty timeless and product-agnostic, it's just the strategy and context changes depends on what is being sold.  Great sales teams can adapt to any industry and end up only selling on something they believe in anyways.

Convincing a group to build on NoM is sales any way you cut it.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2023-07-02 16:42:18 UTC | #46

Who said anything about web2? I'm talking sales of any kind.

I'm sure if I input my paragraph into chat gpt, it would say something about how when selling you don't want to mention the features (what I did) but instead talk about the benefits to the end-user. I should have highlighted instead:

- You are not getting rug pulled. 
- You can farm two coins, one might pump more than the other.
- Mr. Kaine cannot be killed and bring the price of your coin down.

I'm talking about the fundamental principles of sales.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-07-02 17:32:29 UTC | #47

I've seen countless salesmen gurus and experts desperately failing in crypto so it might not be as agnostic as you think it is. I mean, look at ZNN.

-------------------------

angelo_a_jr | 2023-07-02 18:05:45 UTC | #48

Let's not reference sample pools of losers.

Here are some examples of winners of both direct and indirect partnerships:

-[Polygon x Stripe](https://stripe.com/blog/expanding-global-payouts-with-crypto)
-[Polygon x Nike](https://decrypt.co/137011/nike-unveils-first-swoosh-nft-collection-for-members)
-[Solana convincing Helium to switch networks and securing a T-Mobile deal in the process](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4543485-helium-partners-with-tmobile-5g-what-investors-need-know)
-[Near Protocol x SailGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_in_El_Salvador)
-[dYdX moving from ETH to Cosmos](https://decrypt.co/124623/dydx-reveals-launch-date-move-ethereum-to-cosmos)
-[RNS.ID and the entire country of Palau](https://rns.id/)
-[BTC and the entire country of El Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_in_El_Salvador)

Unlike other L1s, we wouldn't be selling dogshit and if we're all on this forum than obviously we believe in NoM.  Sales is an extension of this belief and any failures along the way are just learnings/data points, not a death sentence.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-07-02 18:07:49 UTC | #49

Is that why Polygon striking one massive deal after another with some of the biggest brands out there? All they do is enterprise sales. Their tech is shit but they don't try to pretend knowing better how to sell to those who matter.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-07-02 18:30:45 UTC | #50

You obviously have 0 ideas about what's going on behind the scene on Polygon. Heard about network? Do you even know who was their MM who gave them this kind of PA? All I heard about ZNN and marketing is about Twitter campaigns and normies targeted marketing. If you talk about facilitators, then it's a different story.

dat_she_pepe | 2023-07-03 14:08:11 UTC | #52

Same. But really we'd need the L1 finished to look serious towards reviewers and people with a bit of a crypto background

-------------------------

aliencoder | 2023-07-03 18:08:01 UTC | #53

If we go by this logic, we'll never be "done". The foundation is already here, there are only a few components that need to be finished.

There are already countless things that NoM has and other networks don't. Why do you like limiting yourself?

-------------------------

angelo_a_jr | 2023-07-03 18:30:20 UTC | #54

Count me in on any of the AMAs.

And @aliencoder is right, there is plenty to offer.  Many projects have long term horizons that sync up perfectly with NoM evolution.

Prime example of long cycle sales are Boom (founded 2014) supersonic jets and first customer flights with [United slated for 2029](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57361193).  That's 15 years of preparation and their sales team is the best in the biz.

There are many L1s who have grown/marketed with much less.  This is our moment/inflection point but we have to all get on the same page to seize it and row in the same direction.

[/quote]

Exactly. 90% of L1s are about "scalability" and "1 trillion TPS", but very few offer decentralization and enhanced security (through PoW). 

Also 90% of L1s are actual companies (backed by VC money) that can disappear tomorrow if they run out of funds or due to regulatory pressure.

We have something that they will never have: principles & an actual community.

dat_she_pepe | 2023-07-03 18:56:18 UTC | #56

I don't know. The sentinels implementation seems kinda important no ? In its current state the NoM is a traditional dPOS network at 10 tps. I'm unable to shill that unless I'm missing something important.

The sentinels implementation seems kinda important no
[/quote]

At the moment we have a stable network that didn't have any downtime in 1.5 years. Very few networks can claim this. 

I'm sure Sentinels will come after the dynamic Plasma is implemented and tested, so they can actually process PoW links - at the moment Plasma generation via PoW works well enough with a small user base.

MrK suggested switching to an ASIC resistant algo before implementing Sentinels anyway.

In its current state the NoM is a traditional dPOS network
[/quote]

I don't think you understand the network architecture at all. 

Let me explain it for your: delegators in NoM are not delegating/staking like in "traditional" dPoS networks.

Keep in mind that dPoS networks are leader based: one leader is elected per round to create a block and can be DDOS'ed (that's why Solana is crashing every time).

Also the validation of transactions is based on Plasma and the PoW adds up to the ledger's weight. This is important in fork resolution to know which ledger is the heaviest - only Bitcoin and PoW networks have this concept implemented and it's called "longest chain of most accumulated proof-of-work".

Therefore Pillars are not participating in a dPoS consensus.

This is a hardcoded cap that will be easily lifted when dynamic Plasma is implemented.

I'm trying to point out flaws and what's needed - according to me and what happens when I talk about Zenon to non normies - for being able to look relevant. Stop crying each time you don't see a blind shiller. The more criticism we have between us, the best we'll look when we go outside of our own bubble.

If someone can write a short article about how the network really work, something technical, it'll help a lot. Because what I wrote above does reflect other's views when I talk about Zenon.

To answer the technical, Pillars are producing blocks, right?

This is exactly my point. The WP has little to do with the actual network. (According to George, and the absence of Sentinels, Sentries role being undefined, etc.)


EDIT: If you label anyone who kinda look down at the state of an unfinished product as a fudder, don't be surprised if we're 30 community members since 2 years. I challenge you, I get it, but don't get me wrong toward what I mean and want. My points will be brought by others, as they have been brought to me. Nobody is going to read an outdated WP.

Now I understand that part of the whitepaper with the "balance of PoW between CPU friendly / ASIC friendly": user PoW must be CPU friendly (users don't have specialized hardware), while ASIC friendly PoW can be powered by merged-mining.

80% of what is in the whitepaper is also in the code (dual-ledger, Plasma, etc). The remaining 20% are implementation details that I believe this community will deliver for Phase 1.

Yes, and I'm telling you that I'm facing the criticism above when I talk to people in private group about Zenon. Those guys wont read a WP, and aren't coders at all. As said above, the tech doc might help. My points remain valid and has not to be taken as criticism towards contributors. It's how the actual state of the implementation is being read. There are quite a few more steps needed to be taken seriously. Right now, we're being seen as a dPOS network. Either they're right or wrong is not important, when the L1 is more advanced those criticisms will fade, in the meantime the technical documentation would need to be crystal clear about that. 

So, the technical docs might well be our best marketing tool? It update the WP by taking away all the outdated information while being readable for non coders too.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-07-03 19:40:36 UTC | #66

Because most of the people in this field can't read code but have a good high level understanding of what blockchains are or can be. Also, attention span, a clear docs is easy to digest. A highly technical WP, not that much.

-------------------------

aliencoder | 2023-07-03 19:44:39 UTC | #69

I get it. Probably they also think other networks like Solana or Cardano are not dPoS networks.

[Solana Docs](https://docs.solana.com/cluster/stake-delegation-and-rewards): "Stakers are rewarded for helping to validate the ledger. They do this by delegating their stake to validator nodes"

[Cardano Docs](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/delegation/): "Anyone who owns ada can participate in stake delegation while retaining their spending power. Note that you can spend your ada normally at any time, regardless of how you delegated it. This mechanism will enable stakeholders to participate in the slot leader election process in each epoch. Stake delegation gives rise to *stake pools* that act in the similar way to mining pools in the Bitcoin protocol. Stake pool operators (SPOs) *must* be online to generate blocks if they are selected as slot leaders."

@dat_she_pepe please ask your friends to run a full node for Solana or Cardano.

If they can't (Solana blockchain [is tens of TB of data](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/963/how-can-i-determine-a-current-size-of-solana-blockchain)), send them a link with Syrius and tell them that Zenon's wallet has an integrated full node that syncs up the network from genesis.

Ok. Let them connect to a "free" RPC node using a "Metamask Web3 wallet" that can censor their txs and sniff out their IP & metadata, while collecting their balances and tx history in a database that will be breached by hackers and get blackmailed in the next bullrun.

cryptocheshire | 2023-07-03 21:53:14 UTC | #74

Most do not care, most will keep using metamask because of network effects and UX, and most only need a convincing argument that zenon is better - by magnitudes - through a single, compelling reason or use case.

Trying to convince people through a multitude of "marginally" better features is a losing sales strategy and always has been (google "sell me this pen"). Most people wont run nodes, don't care about privacy or decentralization, or let alone understand why they should. Most people in this space are in it to trade & speculate on narratives.

That narrative needs a single, key differentiator. In our case it's "Feeless Ethereum for Bitcoin". Thats it. If we can back it up by an actual implementation and some KOLs buying in publicly, most other nuances/benefits of the network (sadly) become secondary to irrelevant to the majority of investors. All people will then care about is UX.

Killer apps do a SINGLE thing massively better than everyone else. They don't win because they do many things "just" better.

This applies to undifferentiated investors, aka the majority of market participants which lead to green candles, which leads to adoption by builders etc.

We can specifically cater to the needs of onchain traders if zenon allows them to extract alpha.

But as long as we focus on the niche market of hardcore techies & decentralization maxis, it will be difficult to scale adoption. BUT all the features these people care about are critical for the long term prosperity of zenon

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-07-03 22:05:14 UTC | #75

The killer dApp for ETH were 1) smart contracts capabilities VS Bitcoin which looked lame to speculators eager to taste a new narrative 2) YFI and the first DeFi products for them to keep betting and 3) BAYC to tiktok it.

Let's do better.

I'm still unable to grasp the scope of Unikernels but I've been told it's big. However I don't know how exactly it can be game changer. Maybe it needs to be pushed more? I vaguely remember Vitalik tweeting about Unikernels being the next big thing in crypto but can't find that back.

Consider the following: https://t.me/zenonnetwork/251536

I can already see every pillar cringing at the idea. Whether or not you support the initiatives (plural), people will use Zenon for data storage eventually. I believe this is Zenon's "killer" feature. 

We have a few solutions that can be achieved today, or we can wait to off-load this utility onto a non-EVM side chain. Either way, we'll probably want dynamic plasma and pruned nodes.
Of course, service providers need to be compensated. We'll address this as we go.

Unikernels are an interesting use case, though I'm unsure how we'll integrate them into the network. Definitely worth its own discussion.

-------------------------

sultanofstaking | 2023-07-04 01:48:56 UTC | #80

AFAIK Unikernals are not being used in prod save for a very few cases. Anything we produce here would be limited to POV.

I enjoy Nostr zapathon. NOM would be perfect for something like that down the road.

sultanofstaking | 2023-07-04 12:40:53 UTC | #83

Meaning the killer app for crypto is being able to exchange value globally instantly without fees or intermediaries - if we did something like zapathon we could push x# transactions (ZNN QSR ZTS bridge from BNB ETH) no fees no downtime - we could do that now to some degree

People don't care about decentralization and therefore they use PayPal just as good for this kind of need. It's not a killer app.

HC1 has started looking into using Nostr as a solution to facilitate PTLC and cross-chain matchmaking opportunities. We've been side-tracked with other work recently and have limited capacity to focus on every task.

While I think Nostr will allow us to more easily transfer value into/out of Zenon, the feeless property (the "killer") is limited to the boundaries of the network. 
We could launch a Damus clone for aliens, showcasing feeless, but I'm not sure if it will impress enough people on its own. We'll almost certainly have this one day, when we gain enough momentum.

The question I ask myself is: what can we do within our ecosystem that is better than anywhere else?
I have a few ideas, but I digress.

Sorry for hijacking the thread. 
I won't try to dissuade or discourage marketing efforts, but I think it will be challenging at this time. 
Gameify the experience, let new participants earn rewards, and help them see that we have something special here. 
It's just not fully baked yet. Set expectations accordingly.

@ZNNAYIID do you still have access to the original to reflect these edits?  If it's a Figma file I have some bandwidth to play around with it as well

Maybe also adding in Sui, NEAR, and Aptos if it is warranted and can fit.

Also the fact that our market cap is < $500K now that we "reset" it on a new chain :sweat_smile:

angelo_a_jr | 2023-07-05 12:16:51 UTC | #88

This seems extremely high leverage.  After a little research it seems like this kind of content can be created very easily.

A potential playbook

1. Parse out NoM concepts into 20-30 individual pieces
2.  Create short ChatGPT video scripts for pieces from step 1
3.  Use AI video generation for scripts from step 2
4.  Create YouTube channel with corresponding tags, affiliate links, etc.
5.  Publish on YouTube
6.  Share on all other relevant platforms

Does anyone have experience trying this out?

A few more marketing ideas that can attract developers to the project:

1. Hackathon event with prizes for the best contributions ([WarpDrive](https://medium.com/@zenon.network/warpdrive-the-pre-alphanet-zenon-hackathon-adc668a2a1fc))
2. Some community members have discussed pooling funds together to offer a bounty for the treasure hunt's solution. An AZ proposal can be submitted to have pillars custody the funds until a solution is published.
3. We can reach out to developers from other block lattice projects and inform them about AZ. 
They'll be familiar with the architecture of this project and can probably adapt to our code quickly.
Look for contributors to: [Nano](https://hub.nano.org/gaming), Banano, IOTA, [Kepple](https://medium.com/kepple-io/experience-the-multidimensional-block-lattice-2b41451207a4), [Nollar](https://nollar.org/), [Lyra](https://github.com/LYRA-Block-Lattice), [Blaze](https://twitter.com/Blazeprotocol/media)
[Decred](https://docs.decred.org/) devs may be interested in our project, as well.

I understand #3 is controversial and will probably upset some people. At this point, any attention is probably better than none. 
These are the people that are most likely to work on Zenon. Maybe some of them are bored or will see an easy opportunity to provide value and get paid. There's nothing wrong with asking.

We can create a list like the one I've compiled above with every website/platform and assign a bounty based on "difficulty".

-------------------------

coinselor | 2023-07-28 17:23:24 UTC | #97

I think that's reasonable, but what matters is AZ releasing the funds, so we could compile a list of platforms with reasonable bounties and create an AZ proposal to gauge interest from pillars. 

The initial proposal would serve to signal a willingness to release AZ funds for this type of work, serving as assurance for contributors plus an expected payout range. Then each individual submits their own bounty reward phase that could be slightly higher/lower.
