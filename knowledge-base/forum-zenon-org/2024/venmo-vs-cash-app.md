Interested in informed opinions on Venmo (Paypal) vs Cash App (Block).

Most of my friends and clients use Venmo. My gut says to educate and migrate them toward Cash App, and I would like to substantiate that feeling.

Most people don't even know that Venmo is a Paypal subsidiary, and they usually react negatively, when they discover that. It would be probably be enough to simply illuminate that fact, but I would like to hear more opinions and informations about Block vs Paypal.

Cash app isn't available in some countries, including mine. I bet the choice for many is de facto PayPal.
