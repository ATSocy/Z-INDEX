Most of the actual code of the AZ projects is stored in GitHub repositories and owned and maintained by the creator of the project.

Theoraticlly one could issue an AZ project, deliver, get paid by the community and delete the repository and consequently leaving the community with empty hands.

The same implies for all the hosted services that are being build, like this forum for example.

What measures are in place to decentralize this among the community? For example, give ownership to repositores to a dedicated community group to ensure it is owned by the community instead of a single user.

How is it done with / for / around bitcoin?

Could a dedicated group of community devs maintain a shared repo to which they export / back up the code of individual repos from other members (e.g. recipients of AZ grants)? Basically a library with shared credentials?

Would need some automation to efficiently deal with versioning.

Relying on a single repo hosting provider is probably also an issue.

Bitcoin has one core bitcoin GitHub user with around 800+ collaborators. All other non core projects have a separate user account. I wonder who owns the bitcoin GitHub account.

The zenon-network GitHub user could fork community repositories. If the zenon-network GitHub user is not accessible we could create a zenon-community GitHub user. All community repositories could be forked by this user. Not sure if this makes any sense, because someone must have access to this user and could do the same thing this discussion started with.

Maybe it's just as easy to fork projects when they become important. It's pretty easy to automate it. Everyone can make a fork if it's a public repository. The downside is that they're all scattered across different GitHub users.
