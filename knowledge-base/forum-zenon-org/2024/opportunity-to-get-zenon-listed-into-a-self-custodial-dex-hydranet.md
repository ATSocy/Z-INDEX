Hello,

There is an upcoming project called Hydranet (HDN). Their dex is gonna be out soon. Some information about the project.

"Hydranet DEX offers a native cross-chain exchange experience via Layer 2 technologies. Trade BTC to ETH directly without bridges or wrapped assets." 

"Hydranet DEX executes trades off-chain, resulting in minimal transaction fees and near-instant confirmation times, unlike on-chain counterparts."

I have briefly connected with them through discord. I feel if its possible we should connect with them and hopefully get Zenon added to their dex. Their team lead said to open a ticket in their support thread in discord. Thoughts?

According to some members in main tg this may be a CEX/multisig disguised as a dex kind of scheme. Be careful

Hm. I would say someone with technical knowledge please look into their project once, cause they are open to have a discussion with us.
