At this stage of Zenon, there are 7 types of participants the network can onboard:

1. Stakers
2. Delegators
3. Pillar operators
4. Sentinel operators
5. AZ proposal submissions
6. Local node operators via an installed instance of SYRIUS desktop
7. Liquidity providers

This post will outline a preview of how we plan to use both inbound and outbound marketing methods to onboard the above participants into the network.

---- 

A marketing funnel could be divided into 3 stages:

Let's break down how various Zenon.Org systems will work harmoniously with one another to create such user journey:

**1. Awareness:**

The awareness stage is the process of attracting web traffic into Zenon. Marketers use a variety of inbound and outbound strategies to place an attractive offer designed to make relevant traffic aware of Zenon. The key is to place offers in channels where relevant traffic is abundant. Your Twitter #hashtagged thread with your 200 followers may or may not generate enough relevant traffic to capture any interest. Here are some examples of how offers can be placed across the web:

1. Stakers / Delegators / Pillars / Sentinels / LPs:
• List Zenon with its APR % in yield product directories.
• Place native ads in relevant publications/networks which target yield-seeking audiences.
• Listen for relevant hashtags / conversations on social networks, and chime in with a relevant tweet about the yield opportunities.
• And many more...

2. AZ proposal submissions:
• List projects in relevant job boards.
• Develop lists of GitHub contributors to similar projects and use tactics to engage with them about zenon projects.
• And many more...

It's important to ask yourself the question: who are our audiences, and what can I tell them which'll be attracting enough to engage them into Zenon?

Once the traffic has been attracted, it gets led to landing pages which allow it to evaluate the offer in more detail.

**2. Evaluation:**

The evaluation stage is the process of educating the attracted traffic with an aim to convert them immediately or at a later stage via retargeting.

The landing page could be an offer to join a pre-recorded webinar about the opportunity and its processes. The goal at to educate so that the traffic can evaluate the whole. It's important to implement methods to capture the user in some form so that he can be retargeted in the case that he doesn't move into the conversion stage. What is retargeting? It's a process of using some form of data to re-present the offer to the traffic, if it didn't convert after the first attempt. Example could include email capture, retargeting scripts on the landing page -- or any other way you can use to re-communicate with the audience which you once captured in the awareness stage, led to a landing page, and didn't convert.

Zenon.Org has developed its own Landing Page System (LPS) which:

* Allows the fast development of new educational landing pages using a framework and customizable components.
* Acts as a the main/organic website.
* Acts as a landing page system for various inbound and outbound marketing channels.
* Provides a mobile-optimized experience (not responsive, completely different design for mobile visitors).
* Tracks event triggers (clicks).
* Supports multilingual translations.

Once the traffic has been educated, it's presented with an opportunity to convert. Leading us to the 3rd stage of the funnel.

**3. Conversion**

The conversion stage is the process of getting the educated audience to engage with your product and ultimately convert into becoming a participant.

We plan to develop a new technology (a dApp) as suggested by @aliencoder, which'll allow landing pages to initiate WalletConnect connections with syrius desktop, so that we can track completed events which signal to us that the user interacted with Zenon on-chain, without tracking his wallet address. We only care about the conversion, whether that's staking, submitting an AZ proposal etc.

The dApp could also evolve to become a web dashboard to connect your address, view statuses and trigger other actions present in syrius desktop. For now the idea is to use the dApp as a mean to onboard participants into the network, in priority to other features.

The dApp is dependant on the SYRIUS desktop WalletConnect integration + deep linking feature. I'm available to collaborate with @aliencoder on requirements / features.

---- 

**My job for the foreseeable future will be to:**

1. Design the dApp and its onboarding experiences. Will likely be built as a separate app from the Landing Page System codebase. It shouldn't take too long to design, I will showcase the experience to the community as soon as I can.
2. Hire a developer to handle the dApp development.
3. Push Zenon.Org live and begin experimenting with grassroots marketing strategies to develop funnels which convert. These funnels will become the backbone of a future Attribute affiliate marketing system, as marketers will need to be given landing pages and funnels which convert. Their job will be to drive traffic (using Attribute links) to widen the net of methods/audiences in the Awareness stage of the funnel.

---- 

**Will Attribute go online?**

Yes, but only after the above has been completed, and Attribute has been improved with additional requirements so that it could fulfil [its vision](https://docs.zenon.org/hypergrowth/marketing/distribution/attribute-affiliate-program/vision). If Attribute is to become a system for automated affiliate payments, it must carefully consider various new systems to limit various risks. It's likely that Attribute may convert from Google Analytics to PostHog, and I expect many iterations of the product until the final architecture is selected.

**What can the community do in the meantime?**

If I decide to place the Attribute link builder online, community marketers will be able to drive traffic to zenon.org landing pages without any expectation of payment to their zenon address (for now). Attribute in this case would keep its Google Analytics integration, and the community would see the events their traffic triggered on zenon.org landing pages using the Attribute analytics dashboard. Community wouldn't know whether their traffic installed syrius / linked WalletConnect, or performed any on-chain transactions -- as the whole is dependant on completion of the dApp outlined above and WalletConnect in SYRIUS desktop.
