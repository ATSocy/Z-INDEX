Not sure what this app suppose to do. After adding the forum it just opens up in the browser; whether the open app-browser function is enabled or not. what's the added benefit exactly?

Allows to follow multiple discourse forums, and provides a notification system within the app. I'd also guess that if you clear your data in your browser, you'd have to login again.
