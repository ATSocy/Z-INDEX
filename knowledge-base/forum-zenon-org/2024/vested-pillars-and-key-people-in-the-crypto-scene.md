This is tall tale. Maybe the more important you'll ever come to read. This a story to tell our grand kids. This is the moment where we all become legendary. Hear me out. Once upon a time, Mr. Kaine and I secretly discussed the very important question of the Vested Pillars - "Should we give those away to Porn Stars?" I said. 

Mr. Kaine blushed like a teenager and he was all cute wearing his white shirt clumsily tugged in his cheap greenish nerdy pants. He said "No Chad, we need influencers and developers who can change the world." As I agreed and my erection immediately depleted, I decided to fight for the right thing. 

Years later, here we are. All together in a tight rancid echo bubble. Let's incentive people who can pick us up, help us, grow us and make us better. 

Earlier today we united in our mom's basement with mehowz, Angelo, Sugoi, Stark, Shazz and many others to bring you all an idea, and hopes.


We want to discuss the idea of distributing vested Pillars to key persons who then would will have incentives to help mid and long term. We think there's a balance to be found: 
- it needs to be marketed the right way. We're not loading job applications, the A.Z projects fund already is here for that.
- however we can use this in order to lure people in. They come for the money, they now can change their mindset as they hold a bag.
- bad actors could be seen as a part of whatever risk management policy we'll go for. There will be bad actors and lazy people. 
- but with a generous offer we'll be able to get more fishes and among them, even the ones who came lazily can have a chance to change their mind along the way: cognitive dissonances are a thing.


Discuss.

If we were to provide social influencers with vested pillars, we would be forced to hope for their continued support. Given it's impossible to ensure that, we can easily be on the losing end of this agreement.

This can be a viable marketing campaign as long as all parties have aligned interests, supporting and promoting the network. If a vested pillar holder acts against us, we don't currently have the means to penalize them.

I would propose an amendment to the pillar contract, allowing vested pillars to be initialized and revoked via the governance contract.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-10-26 23:51:48 UTC | #3

I'd oppose that. Of course there might be lazy people and bad actors. But if the marketing and the project is good enough, our interest will be aligned. Positive incentives will work. Negative ones, not so much. As I said in the community chat:

"All I say is that there is a situation and we need to play it smart and don't think we're worth more than a teeny tiny mcap unknown shitcoin for now. We need them, they don't need us, let's overmine this and make it good for us."

Manage the risk but be generous. Manage the risk as pick the right profiles.

-------------------------

sol | 2023-10-27 00:01:36 UTC | #4

The positive incentive is already baked into the deal. They're rewarded for maintaining a node.

Without my proposed change, the AZ treasury will likely have to pay for these arrangements. 

Are we willing to risk those funds on the assumption that they will support the network, without any guaranteed delivery of value?

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-10-27 00:20:55 UTC | #5

This is why I said we need to engineer the right positive incentive for them:
- economic inventives to make it better than it already is, short term
- incentives to make it better long term. This one can be largely made of beliefs as we'd need to make them think this is the next big thing and it'll be better for them to sell in one year, two year, five year. This is entangled with the finding the right people idea. 

Given the above and unlike an aplication to the A.Z funds for project, the selection and its risk bears down on us. I think we can lure people in, if I may  say, and then make them think differently. Once they have a bag, some might dump, some might not, but cognitive dissonance is a thing. Beside dumping a vested Pillar is a bit harder than just selling out tokens, or it can be made that way. 
I agree that is risky and should we should proceed with caution but if we're smart - and here I have no perfect solution - a seduction plan can turn out being a win win situation. During the call I was compariring it to a seed round: you don't offer those randomly but you don't take it back either. Those people know this kind of rounds and could be attracted that way. They also know that if they do dogshit, they don't get aproached by other projects afterward, unless it's crap memes and they're low tier influencers shilling for 100 usd because they're broke.

People who could be involved in more than one way might be more interested in building a long term relation with Zenon. I'm thinking out loud here. I'm thinking about Vibegawd and Deezy from the Ordinal projects and their work on LN, for exemple. They could have interest in both giving their bag a visibility on CT and looking closer at the code at some point.

-------------------------

SugoiBTC | 2023-10-27 00:57:42 UTC | #6

I support the amendment to the contract for vesting pillars, in case of bad actors hijacking the A-Z funds. Would this be complicated to implement? 

I think the vested pillar initiative is a good idea, as they were mentioned in older Medium articles but we were never given a way to implement them. My guess is that it would be up to us to find a way to grant vested pillars to KOLs and/or competent dev teams, in order to grow our network.

Attached is a screenshot with the only piece of information we have in regards to vested pillars:

-------------------------

TrevorLeahy3 | 2023-10-27 10:04:43 UTC | #7

Its always been my understanding that the vesting mechanism for a pillar like this included a revoke option that would be used based on the returned value to the network. So i like the idea and would really like to see an initiative like this built to gain visibility, but not a fan of gifting important infrastruture with only the hope that anything gets returned.

Seems backwards to what weve been trying to do with AZ.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2023-10-27 11:35:51 UTC | #8

FYI @John-Z did a full rug on his AZ.  Got the rewards for a "marketing" AZ, sold them and never placed the ads.

If we give away pillars with no way to revoke them we should expect more rugz.

-------------------------

Stark | 2023-10-27 13:46:02 UTC | #10

This discussion is highly subject to projections and assumptions. 

I have feelings all over the map about this. My feeling is based on who the imagined recipient might be. Obviously, Elon would be a huge win, and on the other end of the spectrum, someone tweeting Zenon once and then rugging, would be a huge L.

I think if someone wants to pursue this campaign that it is worth trying and seeing what crops up.

-------------------------

sol | 2023-10-27 15:16:30 UTC | #11

I wasn't aware of this Medium post. I like the idea when combined with my proposal:
- Governance vote determines if someone can receive a vested pillar
- Offer vested pillars to KOLs, setting the expectation that they should be onboarding users. If they don't like the proposition, they can decline.
- They can unlock the vested pillar amount in increments based on their pillar's delegation weight.
  - Maybe there's a correlated multiplier for their rewards based on how much they've cashed out.
- They can choose to unregister the pillar and sell the 15k ZNN, or keep the pillar and participate in the network
- If they are absolutely inactive, like Unizen, we have the option to revoke their pillar. No free lunch.

We can afford to experiment, but we should also try to reduce our exposure to risk.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-10-27 15:31:51 UTC | #12

You'll get nobody onboarded with such high demand on from them. Those guys are used to more easy terms. We have to adapt to the market of this kind of offers. Saying "Obviously they can decline" wont change the fact that you'll onboard nobody. Think about it like the Epic Games marketing campaign for free games which started - I think - during the COVID. It effectively onboarded users. Sometimes, you have to turn them into the product rather than making them pay (with time, effort, whatever).

Here you buy a network, not a person to work for you.

Except there's no guarantee that we will ever receive this network of users.

If we don't exercise caution, we will be scammed more often than not.

You don't want to give pillars to people dedicated to the network, but you're willing to bait KOLs (probably scammers) with them?

-------------------------

SugoiBTC | 2023-10-27 17:28:40 UTC | #14

It can’t be too easy, we need some kind of protection to ourselves and the A-Z funds by setting up a guideline. Or else we’d really be committing sudoku by giving out pilars for free..

It also weeds out the people that would troll anyway imo.

-------------------------

Stark | 2023-10-27 18:43:09 UTC | #15

My sense is that Chadass has a vision in mind that we can't quite see. I have confidence in his acumen and motivation to act rationally on behalf of his, and our shared interests, where they are shared. 

I feel like the discussion is bringing some more resolution to the picture. Seems good to be bringing the general concept of VPs back.

Hah I'm proud that ZenonORG Pillars were one of the few to vote NO on that AZ, and the only ones to vote NO again when it came to funding. I've always warned the community about marketing AZ's: https://zenon.tools/accelerator/ccb6c92b4de1b8b225013ff2102157bc6e20f04b5f68beab3dc67d7b4b592245#phases

But my experiences around TC tells me that select KOLs are one of the primary reasons why RUNE went from cents to dollars. I will share thoughts on the whole tomorrow.

cryptocheshire | 2023-10-28 05:46:52 UTC | #18

I support Chadass's idea. We should explore it. Good KOLs are a critical growth vector in this space. Dismissing them would be fatal.

And by far not all KOL's are scammers. We should obviously be selective and do our DD

-------------------------

I voted no too, but voted yes for funding after the community approved the AZ.

If we bet on 10 person's and 3 scam us I'll still consider it a win. We paid a tremendous amount for websites with no questions regarding monthly visitors or increase in the brand reach, just saying.

-------------------------

SugoiBTC | 2023-10-28 19:09:16 UTC | #22

Yeah, at least with vested pillars we'd be able to revoke them if the other party doesn't hold their part of the bargain (if we implement it correctly). 

Hoping we can get @sol and the rest of the HC1 team to help us out and get this initiative going!

So the idea is to offer pillars to various crypto influencers and say "Here's free money. You can do whatever you want with this. No strings attached."
And we're expecting some of them to become interested in the network because we simped for them?

What's our metric for success?

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-10-29 05:22:47 UTC | #26

Founding devs wrote some half assed specs on vested pillars but never delivered: https://medium.com/@zenon.network/building-bridges-4ed4eb6988a

If we wanted to have a vesting mechanism it might require an update of the embedded SC but this is not absolutely critical imo.

Recipients will be hand picked based on strategic merit and, once they're up, they will have to run pillars a certain amount of time in any case.

KOLs should be firms/partners that align with zenon's vision. 

Giving bags to proper KOLs to promote a project is a most elementary part of the crypto playbook if you want anyone to know you exist. That's just a fact and denying it would be naive.

We literally wasted thiusands in znn on fake promises for banner ads (which are super low effect as every msrketer can tell you). An aversion against using KOLs who are so much more effective would be illogical.

We can also tier payouts so that every 5k znn / 50k qsr gets released once the KOL has converted X number of new community members to zenon, which we can measure thanks to attribute.me.

Yes there is a chance that partners will take the money and dump the coin but it will have been only after they delivered value. And instead of just paying them in coin there is an actual probability the paid coin is locked up and used to run pillars.

At the risk of repeating myself: not every KOL is a bad actor. A KOL is simply a person or firm with a community.

On your remark re: simping, I'd like to remind you how religiously Kaine's five bullet point roadmap is being followed devoid of any market validation. And that after he dumped a half-baked protocol into the laps of volunteer community devs and after he caused a speculative pump around bitcoin interoperability he never delivered. 

In this space noone is too good to use KOLs. They are the #1 growth vector for anything. Worth getting used to that.

This is more in line with the Medium post and [my response](https://forum2.zenon.org/t/vested-pillars-and-key-people-in-the-crypto-scene/1660/11?u=sol_sanctum) above.
I'm not opposed to this plan. 

@dat_she_pepe do you agree?

Side note: Pillars can only reclaim the ZNN. Vested pillars may or may not burn QSR when initialized, tbd.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-10-29 14:55:35 UTC | #28

No, the idea if to social engineer partnerships in an easier way by leveraging the vested pillar tool. Again we thrown away thousands and thousands for a website with no metrics asked toward its effect on the brand. We need a network, we can buy it.

CHR is doing that with their L1. They gaveaway validators (at seed level, so almost free VS the market) to firms and influencers (not your low level CT shillers). They will get tokens once the L1 is live and the validators producing blocks (I reckon). As frustrating as it can be for people who work in a certain way, those people would participe in the network by leveraging the social assets they gained through a similar amount of work. 

Now ask yourself this: They will not shill on CT, not only. They also have contacts in private groups, whales traders, investors, other KOLs, they might know developpers, market makers etc. All of those are very hard to measure. Let's stretch it: is one person from Jump MM joining our TG the same "+1 user" as my normie cousin I installed Syrius for? How do you put that on metrics? How do you measure that? What about the longterm effect and reputation of those people talking about ZNN in rich yatch parties, OG DeFi rooms or cryptographer summits?

You want ZNN to become a part of their culture. And this will be hard to play but deserve an open discussion. As Shazz pointed, the aversion toward KOLs might be illogical; I personally think it comes from the idea that this doesn't look like work from a certain perspective and therefore it's not valuable.

The truth is that it doesn't matter. What matters is the network and how we can benefit from them. We're sitting at a poker table, so how we can PLAY them is the question.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-10-29 15:24:14 UTC | #31

-------------------------

sol | 2023-10-29 18:31:35 UTC | #34

No, I'm trying to define a vested pillar's life cycle, from concept to result (success/failure).

How do we nominate a KOL?
How is the pillar funded?
What is our success criteria?
How do we minimize our risk?

Your answer is different than what Shazz has described.
Most, if not all of us, agree we should try to offer vested pillars. Let's discuss what that means in practice.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-10-29 20:30:22 UTC | #35

- Identify a suitable KOL
- Tell him/her we have a vested pillar available
- Negotiate terms, incl. but not limited to running a campaign on the KOL's pillar acquisition, set up, motivation behind doing so, broader insight into the network & community etc.
- upon delivery (communication towards the KOLs community that he/she supports zenon by running a pillar, potentially incl. conversion of new community members), AZ releases funds to set up a pillar
- if vesting mechanics are available at that point, great. If not, we hope the KOL is honest and the payout is tiered accordingly..

Most KOLs want to be paid up front. To minimize our risks we should create a lead list and reach out to them pitching zenon and why we want to fund their pillar for them. Depending on their reaction and interest we can assess if any genuinely want to support the network or just look for a payday.

-------------------------

sol | 2023-10-29 21:31:02 UTC | #36

Let's drill down on the success criteria. If these aren't defined well, we risk losing considerable treasury funds to actors that do the bare minimum or nothing at all.

Chadass stated that this process shouldn't feel like a job. It sounds like he's advocating for loose-to-nonexistent success criteria (paraphrasing: "let's give them free money, no strings attached, see what happens").

Shazz is saying there should be a marketing awareness campaign to help the KOL's audience learn about Zenon, and maybe we include conversion metrics. This process will require some level of effort.

Some metrics that we can potentially leverage:
- Attribute.me marketing campaigns and CTR
- Wallet downloads
- The KOL's proprietary platform metrics (e.g. Youtube/Twitter engagement, viewer retention time, website traffic, etc)
- Bridge affiliate volume
- ZNN/QSR purchases via DEX or OTC
- Pillar uptime
- AZ voting participation
- Pillar delegation weight
     - minimum delegation time threshold for each address
     - minimum number of delegators


The first three items can be valuable if the data is generated organically; unfortunately, these can and will be sybil'd if there is enough incentive. I think bridge volume isn't sybil resistant, as well.

Do we have a way to track purchases? Maybe [this](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v1/guides/iframe-integration) can be part of the solution?

I guess I'm asking: 
- How do we assess conversions of prospects -> hodlers?
- What metrics will we use to gauge the success of these expensive campaigns?

------------------

What's our strategy for minimizing risk?
In response to the "hope we don't get scammed" approach: I don't trust most people in this space, even if you have excellent DD, they're doxed, you vouch for them, they have a reputation to uphold, etc. 

A few benefits of a vested pillar contract:
1. AZ may not need to pay 300k+ QSR for these pillars
2. We can revoke inactive pillars
3. We can implement a tiered payout system as outlined in the Medium post
   - Even this is flawed and subject to collusion

Vested Pillar budget comes out of AZ fundTo minimize risk, we dont give away a pillar in one go but split it up into 3 AZ grants worth of contributions based on certain delivery milestones.

This, however, prevents pillar vesting and introduces risk of deal failure bc existing pillars have to click "yes" 6-8 times before the partner gets the funds.

If you have vesting, we should be able to give away a pillar in one go to strategic partners. Thats no different than strategic allocations during a capital raise. Our risk will be determined by what the vesting mechanism looks like @sol

Btw the single good thing about znn's lack of liquidity is that any strategic partner is much likelier to just hold their bag and promote the project it rather than to dump it right away

[/quote]

QSR = 290,000 to launch a pillar.  So to manually give away a pillar would take 12 approvals.  From what I read the vested pillar program was intended to be an embedded contract.  

Establishing vesting requirements would be pretty easy:
- Uptime % (Some min threshold)
- Liveliness (voting on AZs)
- Voting Power (# of delegators & total delegation)

Pillars could receive all the emission rewards initially.  There could be a lockout period to prevent disassembling the pillar.  Then the ZNN could vest based on the criteria above over some period of time.

TrevorLeahy3 | 2023-10-30 12:44:03 UTC | #44

These two ideas from the article make sense.

- For this first chapter, we decided to start integrating acknowledged Validator teams, having the most experience managing networks of nodes.


- The vested Pillar contract will contain a locked amount of 15,000ZNN. The Validators can unlock the coins in 4 stages (25% per stage) by reaching a preset voting power.

We'll be asking a high net worth individual to take a big risk on their reputation, operate infrastructure, and participate in governance, in exchange for what, exactly?

$30k node 
- QSR burnt
- 15k of ZNN, subject to pillars vote
- $10k of current liquid value

What is the narrative we are going to present in order to inspire them?

What is the answer to their first question, "What is btc interop?"

Let's say they yolo and take the green pill, happens when they agree to promote Zenon and then get blowback from their followers and peers, who are liable to ask, "What is Bitcoin interop?"

Is this the right timing?

Who said BTC interop' was the selling point for them? It could be low mcap L1 let's bet on it. It could be anything. We've been hearing BTC since ages but I know 0 traders or investors who actually solely bet on FA. Especially in a bear market. Ironically, who else got a vested pillar is most likely to work.

I believe those are granted to users of the network.

My suggestion would be to try and find a way of creating a partnership with Hourglass $WAIT, they are relatively new project aiming to take Web3 mainstream and  have a billionaire (Jeff Mahoney) backing them. Importantly they can get things done, quickly. They are the project behind The Next Crypto Gem TV show, it wasn't to my taste but it illustrates that they are a serious project. They approached some of the most influential names in crypto and got them on the show.

The TV show is just the tip of the iceberg, they are announcing new deals and incubating new projects all the time, they've signed deals with an asset management group in Singapore, formed a VC fund and are about to make a Web3 movie with a budget 40x of the TV show.
I think this would be a good way for us to get exposure,  Jett Tang (@ultrastarter on X) is their leader and he is open to collabs. They are going to announce their staking app on a Layer 1 soon, so we may have missed the boat there but I believe they will become a blue chip project and it might be worth brainstorming some ideas so we can build a relationship with them.

Why not put a pitch book together and sell it to VCs to back a team to help deliver Phase I?

We would offer them x# of vested pillars that would vest upon delivering Phase I.  We could establish the deliveries. And phases to get them.  Maybe they get AZ too.  

The VC would fund the team and have a split with them to retain pillars and AZ funds.  That would be between the VC and team.  We have such an amazing foundation and network design.  We need to deliver Phase I. I suspect engaging a VC and team would also include some marketing and hype.  

@mehowbrainz how did the TC team get 9R involved with TC?

I was loud in the outbound until a guy named Gavin reached out to me via DM, I brought him to the TC leadership. His team later formed 9R and began their contributions to TC. They cleaned up TC real good.

do you know how are they compensated?

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2023-11-15 19:52:37 UTC | #59

I'd assume some allocation, but I don't have a labelled tx which would confirm it. If it wasn't for 9R, I don't think THORChain would be as successful as it is today. They implemented THORsec/audits, streamlined efforts across the board.

ya, I agree.  9R took TC to where it is today.  Mad props to what they have accomplished.  They deserve their current success.

Now that they're rich, can we convince them to come to zenon?

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2023-11-16 22:44:02 UTC | #62

good question.  @mehowbrainz think you could get them interested?

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2023-11-17 16:43:13 UTC | #63

No chance in a lifetime. They've got too much work at TC, and Gavin seemed to have had a centralized version service of THORChain IRL (from what I recall), so it seemed like a natural match for him.

Wonder what's going to happen with Nodes when the SEC comes after them and labels them 'brokers".  I love TC, but there are a lot of risks ahead.  I guess it also depends on who is president in 2024.
