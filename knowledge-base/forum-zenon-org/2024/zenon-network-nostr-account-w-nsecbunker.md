I've recently discovered Nsecbunker.com

Here's a good article explaining what it does: https://habla.news/tony/nsecbunker-v2

Basically, it would allows us a similar (probably even better) feature to the X account delegation we are currently using. We could create and delegate posting rights on-demand to anyone without revealing a nostr private key. 

We could either self-host or paid for hosting. I'm personally more in favor of supporting the Nostr developer. 

The idea is to cross-post any Zenon content to more platforms. 

@SugoiBTC and I already started a [Coinmarketcap Community](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/Zenon_Network/) presence, and the idea is to keep expanding further.
