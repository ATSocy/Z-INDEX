Guys,
@sol @CryptoFish @vilkris @aliencoder @mike 

I've been chatting with Alien about the AZ we need to submit for the last round of Syrius wallet improvements.  Are you guys OK with submitting one or two AZs and then break up the proceeds?  If so, do you want to post the amount you would like to request with the work performed?  You can DM me too.  I'm happy to put it all together and submit it so you can focus on coding and I can focus on helping.  

Thoughts?

I think it's a good idea, I've send you a DM.
