@vilkris it would be great if we could add Pillar vote participation on the Pillar page here:  https://zenon.tools/

That way delegators can see which Pillars are engaged in the community.  I hope delegators will consider all factors: uptime, rewards, participation, etc.. in deciding how to delegate.

Yes this is a good idea. I'll look into adding it after I get the new version of the site live first.
