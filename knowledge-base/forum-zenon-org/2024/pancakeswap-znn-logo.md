I'm working to get $ZNN listed on Rango Exchange.  It's a multistep process.  It looks like the first step is to submit our logo to Trustwallet to be added to their asset repo.  

The logo requirements are (https://developer.trustwallet.com/assets/requirements):
* File Extension: `png` (Uppercase PNG is considered invalid)
* File Name: logo.png
* Size: 256px by 256px
* Background: Preferably transparent

Once we submit the Pull Request to add the logo we need to pay 5 BNB.  So I want to be 100% sure the community accepts the proposed logo.  I created the one below by taking the SVG, padding it, and then converting to .png.  Here are samples of other logos on Trustwallet.  We only have one shot at this.  We don't want to submit and pay again to change it. https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/tree/master/blockchains/smartchain/assets

I've compared ZNN to other logos and I think the padding is not necessary.  See below.

**Can we come to consensus on a logo?**  The previous one provided by Zenon Art & Memes is below.  This version has an outline and it's pixelated.  If you look at the example logo above it's clean with no pixelation.

I'm running through the tokens.... it needs to be round!  All the tokens in the asset folder are round.

Some options.  I'm not good at illustrator.

Feedback from the Marketing Group on TG.  Looks like marketing prefers these logos which are consistent with other brand awareness projects.

Just to clarify, the ring with pink and blue is not my creation. However much I like the multicolor ring, i don’t think it’s right for the pcs listing.

I think best to stick with green and black.

I think it will be good to do a couple more mockups.

1. Without the green circle.
2. Without the black background nor circle.

That would be awesome.  My hope is we can get all the options here on this thread, and then create a new thread to vote on the final logo.

Round with gradient looks good to me, I would just go ahead with that or the two colour round one. Simple and clean

I like this alien concept. seems bold, on message, and on brand.

I also wonder what the subtitle description shall be.
Simply "Zenon" is also an option of course.

I like

and this 

![image|370x141](upload://xd0hLCITmv9k6cmWjWw29KRcDS9.png)

ALSO, we need to define the token.  I believe it should be called wZNN and not ZNN!

-------------------------

mr.ztark | 2022-06-07 22:41:18 UTC | #13

I edited my post below the trust wallet images and added a couple more. sorry for all the spam.

-------------------------

SugoiBTC | 2022-06-07 22:42:40 UTC | #14

I agree with the wZNN part, as the only way to obtain ZNN is to bridge it over to the s y r i u s wallet.

I wonder how some of these look with a black background?  We can only upload one version.

-------------------------

mr.ztark | 2022-06-07 22:43:44 UTC | #16

looking down the pcs list... I wonder if they are playing some kind of psychological game and don't want to "accurately" describe tokens as wrapped.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2022-06-07 22:47:03 UTC | #17

I've looked at many.  Check them out here.  Several do call them wTOKEN.  Also, we can add tags in the json.  And one of the tags is "wrapped"    

I think people are mostly confused when you add tokens here.  Lots of trash in there.  But look at the serious projects and they seem to have it correct.

This one will work best with a white and black background.  You will never match the black circle / outline around the alien with the black used on the website.  Everyone uses a different shade of black.

middle one just has transparent eyes and such

I think the ZN is really hard to see when it’s small like this.  But this is what it will look like on a phone… don’t you think?

I agree. the gradient does not scale down well. Here it is, at right without gradient. Nothing is lost, while clarity is gained.

I’ll put the light mode mock-ups into the same configuration as the dark, above. I think these are the three finalists.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2022-06-08 09:11:42 UTC | #23

@mr.ztark do you want to make a new post asking for a vote on the logo?  Like Option 1, 2 or 3?  Let’s show the logo and them in action with a white and black background.  

I want to get this PR drafted up and submitted to AZ.  I will be asking for reimbursement of 5 BNB to submit the PR to add our logo to trustwallet & PCS.

-------------------------

mr.ztark | 2022-06-08 18:07:34 UTC | #24

Sounds good. I will do the light and dark mode mockups tonight, before midnight EST

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2022-06-08 22:01:04 UTC | #25

Cool.  I think we should keep working on this token and publish it.  Even though we already got the Rango listing.  There will be benefits to getting the token published.
