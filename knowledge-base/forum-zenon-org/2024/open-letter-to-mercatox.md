**To:** 

Mercatox 

**Subject:** 

Deprecation of wZNN, an Open Letter to Mercatox.com

**Message:** 

The Zenon Community is aware that the bridge for the current wZNN contract is being deprecated. The community has been instructed to bridge from wZNN to native ZNN as soon as possible.

If Mercatox custododies wZNN in lieu of native ZNN (Alphanet), this message is to advise Mercatox to pursue one of the two following courses of action. Failure or neglect to take action may result in the total loss of customer assets.

1. Advise customers to bridge their wZNN.

1.A. Halt trading of wZNN (presented as ZNN on the Mercatox trading platform).

1.B. Enable withdrawals of wZNN.

1.C. Advise customers holding a balance of (wZNN) to withdraw and bridge their tokens immediately.

2. Mercatox could bridge the full balance of wZNN in custody to native ZNN Alphanet tokens.

2.A. Note that the bridge functionality is intermittent, and while the deposit of Alphanet tokens is reliable, bridged token deposits may be delayed for indeterminate amounts of time.

Sincerely,
Zenon Community

You misspelled 'custodies.' I think the message is correct and hopefully they get off their fat asses.

I don't wanna be the bad guy but this is an information we should see on the Zenon Network Twitter as well.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2023-03-10 14:29:25 UTC | #4

Looks good.

-------------------------

SugoiBTC | 2023-03-10 19:08:34 UTC | #5

Zend it ser! As the bridge is deprecating and we don't know if the current wZNN contract will continue to exist, we would have to notify Mercatox.

Thank you for doing the needful.

I posted on Learn_zenon.  I think Zenon_Network is deprecated.

You're not the bad guy. Whoever is in charge of the twitter account fails to realize how much they set back the efforts of this community by just staying silent and not signaling willingness to hand over the account.

I will update this thread with any replies from Mercatox.com.

We asked them before and they told us to send money or fuck off. What happened that makes you think this has changed?

An exchange integration tutorial would be usefull. I'm not sure what kind of server-side programming language is serving Mercatox, but the easiest way would be to use one of the Sdk implementations to interact with NoM. Either way they probably have to implement it from stratch, having some developer documentation could lower the adoption threshold considerably. Maybe Stex could give us some insight in how they implemented it?

@vk_stex Please take a look at this post.

oginotvavra | 2023-03-30 17:07:43 UTC | #14

Hi, any news? Is there any further communication with Mercatox?

-------------------------

sol | 2023-11-21 05:06:27 UTC | #15

Today, Mercatox informed me via email that they did not complete the swap to Alphanet.

-------------------------

oginotvavra | 2023-11-21 06:02:45 UTC | #16

And you're going to answer? Or are we seeing any more activity from them? They saw something happening at ZNN and suddenly they're interested :/

-------------------------

sol | 2023-11-21 06:08:27 UTC | #17

I responded by saying their coins are no longer supported by Alphanet, citing the Medium article and this thread.
We'll see if they decide to ask any questions or if they zero-out their holdings without further correspondence.

-------------------------

sol | 2024-02-15 15:52:13 UTC | #18

Apologies for the delay. I must have misunderstood their response because they've since informed me that they have completed the swap to Alphanet.

Mercatox is holding ~20600 ZNN and they wish to hold the same amount in wZNN in order to quickly re-instate trading on their platform. They are aware of the bridge and its 3% tax, and would like to know if we can accommodate one of the following:
1. Peer-to-peer trade 20600 ZNN for 20600 wZNN
2. Reimburse the 3% amount in wZNN after they bridge: ~618 wZNN

The only other option is for Mercatox holders to lose 3% of their holdings.


[details="Latest email"]
Hello Sol,

It would be really good if you could find someone from the community who needs to exchange about 20600 ZNN to avoid the bridge and paying interest. Alternatively, you can cover this percentage for us, as we previously agreed on.

We believe that within a few days after the swap, we will be able to activate the trading.

Best Regards,
Mercatox Team
[/details]

Note: I don't recall agreeing to reimbursing anything.

------------

I'll setup a poll in case the community wants to make a decision. 
If someone wants to volunteer for any of the options, that's fine as well.

ElRegel | 2024-02-15 17:54:30 UTC | #19

Would it possible to ask them if they want to proceed trading with native ZNN?

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-02-15 19:14:06 UTC | #20

The 3% tax would go to the marketing fund. Seems the simplest route. A small price to pay for anyone that has tokens on merc.

-------------------------

Florian | 2024-02-15 19:26:03 UTC | #21

I have been in contact with Merc the last few weeks, regarding the ZNN coins that are still on their platform. This is the latest communication from their side (dated 9 February): 

Dear Florian.

There was a transition process, so the question of delisting was not raised as it was planned to complete the process safely, but then difficulties arose for obvious reasons. We cannot be held responsible for any actions or inactions on the part of the third party project team. In the previous letter, we explained everything and made it clear that in this matter, responsibility lies only with the ZNN project and no one else. You, in turn, as a market participant, should be careful about your funds and study information about the project before making any purchases. The exchange cannot constantly monitor information about the state of affairs in projects.

But there is good news. Our developers delved into the history of previous actions and carried out certain work. There is a possibility that there will be new tokens. Some nuances are being clarified. And yet, two months later we finally received a response to our letter from the ZNN team. We will inform you as soon as we have information.

Sincerely yours,

Josh

Mercatox Customer Service Representative

Florian | 2024-02-15 19:26:53 UTC | #22

So if perhaps somebody else now tries to approach them (in stead of only me) they feel appreciated / heard again by the Zenon team, and the ball can hopefully get rolling towards new listing (of upgraded ZNN coins)

-------------------------

Florian | 2024-02-15 19:28:50 UTC | #23

Apart from this issue, I have traded quite some years with Merc, for certain coins, and they overal seem a good exchange and quite responsive / fair. So if you ask me we should try to continue this existing relationship in stead of searching for a new CEX.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-02-15 20:14:43 UTC | #24

what can I do to help?

-------------------------

bayrum | 2024-02-15 22:51:14 UTC | #25

Would be better to trade native znn. We already have a pool for wznn. Why wznn tho?

-------------------------

romeo | 2024-02-16 00:11:26 UTC | #26

It obviously would be beneficial if we can assist Merc to setup native transfers, if they did indeed perform the alphanet swap.

Stex did it so we know it's possible, would need some Plasma assistance for transactions and some CLI scripting I imagine. Can we commit to assisting them with native integration?

-------------------------

romeo | 2024-02-16 00:13:08 UTC | #27

imo the only benefit for doing wZNN is releasing the locked znn for their holders. For future trading it's pointless whilst we have the bridge

Noting all the fuss recently around getting CEX listings, let's kill 2 birds with 1 stone and get native ZNN working on merc

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-02-17 13:32:51 UTC | #28

Other, what do they need for adding native ZNN support?

Having wZNN on Mercatox would be utterly pointless. I suggest they either consider native ZNN or withdraw funds to their customer on a case by case basis directly on Alphanet.

-------------------------

SugoiBTC | 2024-02-17 17:01:18 UTC | #29

I agree with @coinselor. Considering the fact that they've already performed the swap, wouldn't it be better to email all of the existing ZNN accounts on Mercatox and ask them to provide their ZTS address? Or have them integrate native ZNN so members can just withdraw to Syrius.

Also, a community member has most likely identified the ZTS address of Mercatox: [Swap address - Mercatox](https://zenonhub.io/explorer/account/z1qr7csecv4t2m0d93pz8mxgqkw9etud2dt022na) (not yet confirmed by their team)

-------------------------

Koanwriter | 2024-02-20 00:21:06 UTC | #30

I would like to see them trading native ZNN rather than wZNN. We don't have an exchange carrying native ZNN right now, it would be more accessible for people to get direct ZNN than another exchange with wZNN where you have to pay conversion fees and go through extra steps.

-------------------------

SugoiBTC | 2024-02-27 13:38:42 UTC | #31

Any updates from the Mercatox team zirs? @znn_sol @Florian

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-03-06 17:40:08 UTC | #32

[quote="sol, post:18, topic:1332"]
20600
[/quote]

To be clear, who owns this 20,600 ZNN?  Is this owned by the community with ZNN on Merc?

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-03-07 16:34:26 UTC | #33

Mercatox customers who deposited ZNN on their exchange.
