Zenon.Info descriptors

Listed by author, with the title of the article then its description immediately below. Order of Authors: Shai, Zyler, Shazz, George, John-Z, Sayan and Official/Core-team. @0x3639 @ZNNAYIID @DrD3 

NOTE: My descriptions are brief 1-2 sentences. They are just suggestions, feel free to edit them as you want. The order presented here is just in the order I have done them, totally up for debate how you’d like to present them or group them on the website, or if all of them will be included or not.

NOTE 2: I have not summarized all of the official/core team articles, as some are very old or no longer relevant, but very possible I missed something which should be included. I have also not talked about videos (they are brief enough to just watch for now?) or NFTs (don't know enough about them/premature at this stage)

NOTE 3: I have also included at the very end two links to the Bitcoin Forum Post introducing Zenon. Original was in 2018, then moved to a 2020 post.

And just my idea for a "culture section" if we're doing that:

![image|645x398](upload://tmj3bb2rPlZNC1dcXiFnKDsz8GX.png)


Crypto Publius is an anon artist whose poetry captivated the early ZNN community. The colorful lyricism and deep meaning of his words formed a gravitational pull that kept investors thinking and wondering about Zenon. His stated goal was to alert the public to Zenon, as a public service – but for many his real value was in teasing the audience towards the edge of the rabbit hole. At that point, all it took was a gust of cosmic wind and their lives were changed forever.

Link to his twitter

Zenocratez is the poor man’s Publius. A degen fan so hopelessly in love with his idol that he posts frequently, tirelessly trying to recapture the magic of the dormant Publius. While he has a small and loyal following, it pales in comparison to the legion of admirers that Publius effortlessly commands. Zenocratez is a man that has a lot of feelings – but he is also a peak autist. For maximum entertainment, be sure to check out his failed AZ applications and the corresponding poetry detailing his heartbreak and angst.

Link to his twitter

And i noticed there was some soft schizzo material in the other post … perhaps this can be the final section in the culture tab? I’d be in favour of including it, and also concluding it with something which is to the tune of “Finding out more is left as an exercise to the reader” … but up to you guys!!
