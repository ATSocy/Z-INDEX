Can you guys should us how to generate links that track attribution?  For example, we should track referrals from @cryptocheshire @zyler9985  Medium articles, and others.  Don't you think?  This can help us generate more content that drives traffic.

The zenon.org will have all that enabled by default and a link generation tutorial will be provided for our attribute.me tooling that’ll allow anyone to generate tracked links for themselves with just 1 click. Performance analytics data will be public and accessible to anyone (no need for an invite-based dashboard). You’ll be able to use your links in articles, Twitter etc.
