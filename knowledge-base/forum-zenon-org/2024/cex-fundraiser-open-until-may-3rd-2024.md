As many of you might already know, during the past few months our community has been actively pursuing  exchange listings for native ZTS assets, starting with ZNN. 

Based on the following poll, there have been many community members that have shown interest and that is great to see!

**Link to poll:**

**Current listing options**
As we are exploring more listings, @0x3639 and @CryptoFish have been working on a native integration guide for ZTS tokens that can be used for future CEX listings. In the meantime we would like to ask the community to consider the following options:

$150k usdt listing fees
$300k usdt exchange deposit
$100k znn listing campaign for user distribution
>
>Bitmart:
$30k listing fee
$15k usdt + $15k znn liquidity

$60k usdt listing fee
>
>CoinTR Pro:
$30k usdt listing fee
$5-10k usdt marketing liquidity
>
>Xeggex [(already paid & integration in progress)](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/az-cex-integration-xeggex-and-mercatox/398):
$2.5k usdt listing fee

>Latoken:
$40k usdt listing fee

**Where to list? (based on contributions)**

We should aim to officially start raising funds April 1st, and keep it going for all of April.

Unless people might think it's a joke :sweat_smile:

-------------------------

DrD3 | 2024-03-30 17:38:22 UTC | #3

How bout creating a ZTS token that can be sent to contributors?  Bragging rights always provide extra incentive

-------------------------

TrevorLeahy3 | 2024-03-30 17:58:11 UTC | #4

I also think holding off on spending the fund and seeing how Xeggex works out would be a good option too, maybe 3 to 6 months.

-------------------------

oginotvavra | 2024-03-30 19:51:31 UTC | #5

I dont think we should wait / lose time another 6 months :man_shrugging:

-------------------------

SugoiBTC | 2024-03-30 19:51:39 UTC | #6

Lmao, what if we do tiers per amount of $$ contributed and everyone gets an nft 😂

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-03-31 10:52:45 UTC | #7

I think we could use the depositor's address to airdrop the NFT directly on the extension chain, given it's EVM compatible.

-------------------------

tapwoot | 2024-04-01 15:31:52 UTC | #8

I will contribute the amt I pledged in a few days

-------------------------

Yourself_ZNN | 2024-04-02 07:29:09 UTC | #9

MEXC is winning.
Q: is MM included in the $60k?

-------------------------

SugoiBTC | 2024-04-03 23:35:39 UTC | #10

MM is not included for MEXC, we should start looking for MM services too if we decide to list there.

-------------------------

DrD3 | 2024-04-05 11:29:08 UTC | #11

Would it be possible to create a community address to accept $ZNN donations? Then after the time-period for donations lapses the owner of this address can bridge out the zennies and convert them to ETH?

-------------------------

sultanofstaking | 2024-04-08 13:46:06 UTC | #12

I dont mind doing this with the SOS Community Address - if we get a large amount swapping to ETH will cause a small price dip though... and of course there is trust involved.

-------------------------

sultanofstaking | 2024-04-10 16:35:52 UTC | #14

Seeing hearts and no thumbs down (maybe Hewwo is on vacation) so will go through with this.

-------------------------

Yourself_ZNN | 2024-04-13 21:44:12 UTC | #15

I see. The community wants Zenon to grow without a proper tier 2 exchange - minimal donations made both on the Multisig and the SOS community addresses. Pure expectation won't help. What happened to the poll participants? Altered willingness to contribute? And people in the community question my doubts about the future of Zenon...(and yes, I've contributed $2k total worth while voted for $1k)

-------------------------

SugoiBTC | 2024-04-13 22:29:56 UTC | #16

You’re not alone sir, I’ve also donated $1k.

I guess people would rather wait on Xeggex… But it’s kind of disappointing to see so many people ask wen CEX, and now there’s only a handful of people chiming in 🤷‍♂️

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2024-04-14 00:38:52 UTC | #17

I'm in love with the price action since you guys took over. Maybe you'd need more people like me and less of your... ideas.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-04-14 11:08:00 UTC | #18

I personally think we need to raise X for Y CEX.  Rather than a general raise.  That way the contributors know exactly what they are investing in.  

Looks like MEXC had the most number of votes.  Maybe we would get more participants if we said we are raising 60k to list on MEXC.

-------------------------

TrevorLeahy3 | 2024-04-14 11:29:22 UTC | #19

Many larps... even hewwo came into the thread. The votes from tg for large contributions were likely the same thing. 

Xeggex for a few months will be a great test, and we will see what needs to happen from there. Thank you for the time getting this organized.

-------------------------

DrD3 | 2024-04-14 17:56:17 UTC | #20

Still a minnow tryna save up for a Senti- but I will donate the zennies I committed to in the poll before the campaign period ends.

-------------------------

The discussion is public, but talks happen with a representative of the respective exchanges.

We still have AZ to top up any shortfall if needed, but I wouldn't want to have any more than 1 max proposal. Keep donating 🙏 need some Pillar chads to front up with some rewards as donations rather than sending to the bridge

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-05-03 15:41:07 UTC | #25

Few more hours left for the fundraising event to come to an end. 

We'll tally up results and engage the community about next steps. 

Stay tuned.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2024-05-04 11:12:23 UTC | #26

Bros raised $5k that's a strong community right there. Where are the devs who got basillions from A.Z ? 🤣

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-05-04 20:28:53 UTC | #27

Here's the results of the fundaising event:

[/quote]

There was a brief discussion in the Zenon TG where community members agreed on moving forward with Xeggex and wait until we see price appreciation before deciding what exchange to choose.

Preferably we would like to list on a bigger exchange, instead of spending current contributions on another lower-tier exchange, as we would already have Xeggex.

Do keep in mind that we will also be able to integrate native QSR on Xeggex, once ZNN gets listed.

Yes, the plan is to roll-out the Wallet API first alongside the Xeggex listing. After that we can re-establish comms with Mercatox.

Now that the first phase of the CEX fundraiser has been concluded, we would like to set a specific target for a listing. 

**Current stats of contributions:**

> SoS (@sultanofstaking) Community funding address: 10,591 ZNN 
> Multisig fundraiser wallet: $3466 USDT + 1332 wZNN

----
**Next steps**

With Xeggex already on the way, we would like to ask the community how to proceed next. Should we target a higher tier exchange at a higher price and stick with Xeggex? Or use current contributions and set a lower target to list on a lower tier exchange. 

Please cast your vote below:
[poll type=regular results=always public=true chartType=bar]
* Target larger CEX, stick with Xeggex
* List on a cheaper CEX
[/poll]

**NOTE: Ascendex could not be added to the original poll. In case the community decides to list on a cheaper exchange, please vote on your CEX of choice**

[poll name=poll2 type=regular results=always public=true chartType=bar]
* MEXC
* CoinTR Pro
* Gate.io
* Kucoin
* Latoken
* Bitmart
* Ascendex
[/poll]

-------------------------

Koanwriter | 2024-05-08 17:21:54 UTC | #34

Whatever we do, I say wait until after ZNN has been out on Xeggex for at least at least a week or two. That way, all the possible bugs have been worked out of the process before engaging with another exchange, and if we see any upwards price action from that listing, we can trade in the ZNN pool for more value, and maybe get a higher tier exchange. I'm open to the Ascendex listing, it seems like a good value, and since ZNN has such low supply, getting on it on multiple, decent exchanges should push the price up - which will allow more holders to donate, and give us a lot more options for promotion & further exchanges.

-------------------------

oginotvavra | 2024-05-14 12:03:45 UTC | #35

@SugoiBTC What is the current status with Xeggex? Weeks and weeks go by and they just keep testing and testing.. or is there some other issue that needs to be fixed? thx

Btw. it seems like there are only devs left, HC1 members fighting with each other, several core members who are active on TG, but the rest of the community is gone, its like a ghost project rn. There is no willingness to use some AZ funds to help the project grow and come back from the dead (in marketing way).

-------------------------

CryptoFish | 2024-05-14 12:53:14 UTC | #36

I'm a hc1 dev, and I can assure you none of your points hold any truth.

I don't think you realize how fast things are actually going. It's been only two months since we started with the development of the Wallet API, not to mention all other related work.

The XeggeX integration is going smoothly. It's a back and forth development process, in which we want to take away as much as work possible at the CEX side. The integration progress is also a testing ground for future integrations. We want to make sure it's secure, reliable and easy to integrate.

The current status XeggeX just installed the latest version and is adjusting its implementation to integrate the auto plasma feature.

Zoon™

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-05-14 18:05:18 UTC | #37

I could not agree more.  CF and I have been working hand in hand for the past two months with XeggeX.  I give updates on TG almost daily.

I spend my TG time on Zenon Official Community Inu - found here. t.me/zenonofficial. Feel free to join that if you want updates.  

We have more devs working now than I can remember in the past two years.  

If anyone is unhappy with the marketing you know what to do.  Take action!  I look forward to your proposal to improve what you feel is lacking.

-------------------------

oginotvavra | 2024-05-15 09:54:48 UTC | #38

TG- I've been there since the channel was created.. The same members are there that are in the other groups. cca 140 core members+some bots, average Joes/members disappeared/left this project.

I didn't say anything bad about CF or you 0x, you both doing great job for this surviving project. When we wrote here about a year ago that we needed CEx exchanges to get more attention+to grow the comunity, everyone was like fuk off, we are proud DEX project and now everyone's shaking so we can at least be on Xeggex (thanks both of you for arranging this)

Only EovE7Kj gave at least a nice estimate delivery time for the completion of certain phases of his project. The rest is a big punk style "I'll deliver when I deliver and still get paid whole AZ proposal", If I worked like this in a regular job, I'd be fired soon.

[/quote]

Are you sure about that? I cannot speak for others, but if you make such a claim be sure you know what you're talking about. All the proposals I made contained estimates and delivery was well on time. Please read the following AZ proposals again and tell me otherwise.

- https://github.com/KingGorrin/znn_sdk_java/blob/main/az.md
- https://github.com/hypercore-one/ledger-app-zenon/blob/main/az.md

Other projects like the Syrius update or the Wallet API expand in scope while development is in progress and depend on collaboration with others. Initially started as Ledger Support for Syrius evolved in a complete update. I'm pretty proud on how this update was handled, tested and released.

- https://forum.hypercore.one/t/syrius-v0-2-0/328/5

The delivery of the Wallet API was estimated to be delivered on end of April (excluding integration time). The project was started without making an AZ proposal to safe time. The project has been delivered 10th of May. Not bad for an undefined project.

-------------------------

oginotvavra | 2024-05-15 11:09:19 UTC | #40

ok, I wrote it broadly, I wasn't aiming at the wallet api or your work specifically. What is the technical possibility to have a dashboard for open projects and see their current status +details (0-100%) like we had for SDK projects? So that the whole community can access it and not have to keep asking

-------------------------

oginotvavra | 2024-05-15 11:11:18 UTC | #41

can someone check exactly how many active users are on the forum where the most important things should be discussed?

[/quote]

Technically it's not a problem. The difficulty lies in getting everyone to actually use and update the dashboard. If the devs do not do it, someone else has to ask and keep the dashboard up to date, unless all development environments somehow automatically update it. You can ask @0x3639 how rewarding that job is.

The community sets the standard. If a dev can just dump code and get paid, than that's the standard. Why would he/she borther spending time updating dashboards, test code, write documentation, etc, if nobody is demanding it?

And you think the standard is set correctly when there's hardly anyone left in the community? I don't think so (just my opinion), that's why people don't care/leave anymore. Remember how active the chat was about 3 years ago.. now only a several users post stupid articles from X over and over again, almost zero conversation about znn, next steps, etc

And ye, I've read all of DeeZ's articles about open projects, he should be definetely rewarded for that work. He kept the community well informed.

Thank you for the asnwer

I'm not a negative person, but you can't just pat yourself on the back about how everything is great and going according to plan when it's not. We need to talk about the views that not everyone likes

and 30 user visits a day are still the same ppl.. Even that's a small number

-------------------------

romeo | 2024-05-15 12:45:01 UTC | #46

It's not the same 30 people every day, the forums unique page views and engagement are pretty solid noting the price action and market conditions 

Also - as said already dev activity is at an all time high which I would argue is a better indicator of progress

Anyways less talk and more brainstorming ideas, start up a new post to discuss growth opportunities 🙏

I did submit an AZ many month ago to continue the Dev updates.  There was some back lash against me wanting to prevent tracking and monetization of those articles.  Then TG main self destructed which caused me to focus my time on Discord and Zenon Official Community Inu.

From where I stand development is going awesome.  I could not be more excited about all the great things we are working on.  As @CryptoFish stated, there is no real incentive for me or others to take the time to inform the community what is going on.  I personally don't care about price action and I'm focused entirely on getting shit done.

I personally think there is a moat around the ability to market, so I'm just spending time on being productive rather than swimming across a moat with alligators.

Ser, chill... You have to realize that the community devs are working as hard as they can. Remember that NoM is fully community driven, and complaining does not get us anywhere.

It is good to provide feedback on what you want to see improved, but please do so while remaining respectful. All NoM contributors: devs and non-devs have love for the project and along with it's investors we all want to see success.

So rather than to complain, look for ways on how you can contribute to our growth.. Or wait for contributors to deliver.

We have the ZIP process for core changes, but besides that the standards are pretty low tbh. That's also because we're still very small and learning, both devs and community grow as we proceed. @georgezgeorgez has thought a lot about this and from what I've learned from him is that eventually you have to incentivise good behaviour somehow. Turns out that's a complicated matter.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-05-15 13:11:02 UTC | #50

@oginotvavra rest assured we have amazing contributors to this project who are very talented and committed.  And I believe we have more contributors today than we did 2 years ago.  I watch github very carefully and look at all PRs and issues.  Devs are popping up out of nowhere.  For example > [this guy](https://forum.zenon.org/t/syrius-wallet-mobile-app/659/192?u=0x3639).

I will work on a dev update once I get the supernova explorer working.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-05-15 14:36:13 UTC | #51

I would like to see more community building initiatives. I applaud the aliens doing the poker meetups, or creating meme coins, or even talking about grass on community channels to develop the alien culture further. All these things make up NoM, not just the codebase. 

Think about what you can bring to the table, and add value. Or as Kaine used to say, let others add value.

Constructive criticism by pointing out what's missing or could be improved is more than welcomed, as well as trying to raise the standards for deliverables that go through AZ.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-05-15 16:16:50 UTC | #52

Great points.  I think our last community call on Discord went well.  Maybe we have a twitter spaces next.  We had a good turn out last time.

I personally don’t care about price action and I’m focused entirely on getting shit done.

I know and respect everything that has been said here. It never ceases to amaze me the enthusiasm you all still have (I mean that in a good way). I just wanted to know if there is any will to change/improve the standards.

The only thing I disagree with is that we shouldn't care about price action. At the current moment everything costs many times more than it could cost (dev projects, integration to CEXs, possible marketing etc). The community has been entrusted with AZ and if you have your own business, you are not indifferent to finances either.

I can appreciate that.  It would be nice if the price was up only. It would make things "easier" for sure.  I just don't think any developer is going to focus on that right now.

I personally think we need clarity on the BTC scaling solution or the path to N&T integration to be able to market anything.  Without these what are we marketing?  ... an autistic alien subculture that requires years of diligence to understand.  It's a hard sell.

How do you think we can be marketing the project to improve price action given the information we have today?

I'm not as tech skilled as the rest of you guys here. You mentioned that KAS had a marketing firm that helped them grow from nothing. It may be the way to go, but again, at this point it's cost-prohibitive to do that kind of follow-up.

Attention Zirs! 2 weeks have passed since Xeggex went live. The exchange works like a charm, I'm very grateful to DeeZ for managing stuff on their side, thank you🙏
As noted above, it would be great to expand the exchange repertoire by also listing on AscendEx. Personally, I feel that the marketing side of AscendEx would give Zenon a new dimension of awareness.
The poll confirmed the listing, but we just wanted proof that API is working fine - now we have it 🔥💯
Opinions?

-------------------------

TrevorLeahy3 | 2024-06-08 10:15:05 UTC | #57

Sounds ok here but without a MM plan, for xeggex or other CEX, do we push for another listing right now?

-------------------------

Yourself_ZNN | 2024-06-08 13:49:31 UTC | #58

Very true, but then how should we manage MM?

-------------------------

TrevorLeahy3 | 2024-06-08 18:43:35 UTC | #59

Hard to say, its outside my experience but its not rocket appliances either. We could explore some paid services or coordinate something with a few community members if anyones interested. 

Imo this would be a good use of AZ funds.

-------------------------

Yourself_ZNN | 2024-06-08 20:35:49 UTC | #60

Excellent point made - AZ funds would serve well for this purpose!

was Bitstamp ever an option?  If so we should consider them in light of this news.

-------------------------

Yourself_ZNN | 2024-06-09 12:36:00 UTC | #62

Wait what!? I've just checked and Bitstamp doesn't have a listing fee, they only charge trading fees. Anyone aware if it's true or not? If it is true, why haven't we listed there yet? 😅
Okay, now checked and they have a checklist that need to be fulfilled. Seems ok

The issue with most of the larger CEXs is that they want developer names and contact details, company information and legal documents provided to limit their exposure. The effort needs to go into finding a big CEX that will entertain integration with Zenon without a figure head present

-------------------------

TrevorLeahy3 | 2024-06-10 10:41:38 UTC | #64

Might be some compliance issues but probably still worth a try.

"Existence of tools that facilitate the blacklisting of addresses on the network."

This one is not ideal.

have you been able to make progress or do you need to get more people involved? Thx

-------------------------

Yourself_ZNN | 2024-06-12 17:24:48 UTC | #66

@sugoibtc do we still have the $15k offer? The main question: would you guys agree to maintain the MM from AZ funds?
Reminder: native assets are way more appealing than wrapped ones (ERC-20 is a robbery), especially for newcomers.
Additionally, the marketing aspect of AscendEx would give significant awareness.

-------------------------

romeo | 2024-06-12 22:14:37 UTC | #67

I'm personally not keen to use AZ for MM purposes - but it's not up to me. If you believe in the case create a post about it with the costs laid out and put it to an AZ vote

Do you know how much they require?

-------------------------

bayrum | 2024-06-22 15:51:00 UTC | #68

Why not using the funds exclusively for MM. After the price increase we can list much cheaper with AZ funds or get listed for free if we get exposure. We pretty much dead on Marketing side, bridge is on, we are on a CEX. We can fund from donation or AZ a team the way we did in 2021 to shill and 15k$ for MM. 
I think that awareness campaign was pretty effective and cheap. Pretty sure we can gather some volunteer to shill(me myself) for free. Shilling + MM=> Price increase, exposure => Cheaper listing through AZ funds or even free listing.

I agree. For example, one [small task](https://forum.zenon.org/t/community-marketing-initiative/1520/99) with minimum effort is to get `wZNN` listed everywhere for more visibility.

Are you volunteering? :slight_smile:

I can't for obvious reasons.

Derek1982 | 2024-10-07 19:10:32 UTC | #73

Has there been any recent progress with the CEX listing applications that we donated towards?

-------------------------

Yourself_ZNN | 2024-10-10 22:06:39 UTC | #74

Sirs, fair question,  what is the status of a CEX listing? Many of has have donated a significant amount.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-10-14 13:22:03 UTC | #75

We are basically standing by. Most of the funds are in custody of @sultanofstaking community's address, and the rest in the CEX multisig. 

If anyone is looking to lead an initiative to a CEX listing, they are more than welcome to do so. Take action, rally the community for support, and let's get it done. @0x3639 has voiced his support to help any CEX integrate NoM using the wallet API. 

I'm personally in favor of focusing our efforts in growing our user base in the meantime.

-------------------------

sultanofstaking | 2024-10-15 00:47:31 UTC | #76

Confirmed anyone that donated to me can find theirs here - z1qrcc2c65w4d3zested2wl00hfyhr7022h92l92

I know many who were working on CEX are now working on awareness, extension chains, etc. with the goal of increasing the price before leveraging these funds. I want to put these to use as well and get them out of the community address. I do collect regularly so at least the account is growing.
