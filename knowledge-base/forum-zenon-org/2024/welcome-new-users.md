Welcome to all our new users, feel free to post wherever you want or add new topics as needed. We need help filling out the Questions/Help category and general ZNN info under ZNN.

The forum is split into several categories:

* Off-Topic
* * Twitter Archive
* ZNN
* * Announcements
* Site Feedback
* Marketing
* Questions/Help
* Developers
* Accelerator-Z

The marketing and developer groups have additional permissions - if you would like to contribute to these groups please let a mod know or post here.

If you were part of the legacy testnet please post and let us know so you can be given your legacy badges.

If you are a pillar owner please let us know also so we can allocate Pillar badges to your account for visibility.
