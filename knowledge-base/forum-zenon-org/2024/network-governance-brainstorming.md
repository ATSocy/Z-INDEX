Thread: network-governance-brainstorming
mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:01:05 UTC | #1

I was asked by @angelo_a_jr1

> so if a governance module was implemented and vote was in your favor, what outcome are you specifically seeking for you, .org, the network, etc. specifically?

I replied:

> Well if I could even consider submitting a proposal where I'd seek change, it would be in the following:

> No permanent figure heads. Channel owners, admins, maintainers have cycles. They're evaluated every X periods via elections (also voted on chain), and at each election they bid as candidates. We can set term recurrence like in any democracy. Can force the network to continuously attract new talent which can be responsible for areas of the network. Pillar brands can be seen as "parties".

> High value backlinks / traffic routing. We can set a domain which represents the network i.e. zenon.community. It's also owned by a person voted-in by the network and its ownership is cycled every X period (transferred from one to the next). This domain is the defacto domain used for high value traffic listings i.e. CMC, CoinGecko and others. We then periodically hold an election that would vote which domain .community redirects to. So for example, I cast a bid to have .org the main domain for XYZ reasons, I write my case. Others can cast alternative sites and domains. We have an election. Org wins as an example. For the period of X time, the .community domain will redirect to the .org domain, granting it traffic from these core resources. This forces the active domains to then prove their value over their term. At the next election, new domains can submit their bids and a new election is held. The only advantage .Org has in this case is that it spent years developing technology which can help it win elections. It spent its own rewards to develop those advantages. Would Org need to be open source in that case? Maybe, maybe not. It can pick whether it'll submit an AZ to sell its assets to the network, or whether it'll remain closed source during its term. Perhaps it can convince voters that regardless of being closed source or not, there is still a greater advantage for the network if it used its traffic routes for the network. Or maybe I'll bid with an open source Org? The network will decide with votes, Org just has to present its bid. The .community domain acts as a router.

> There could be "no confidence" elections to change things earlier than the scheduled end of terms. We can easily act like a decent democracy. We just have to formulate the rules in a way where we don't spam the voting mechanism. The rules can be voted-in by the governance module as well. We can also fund someone specializing in web3 political science to come up with the whole.

> Talking off the top of my head. It would be designed to avoid network capture by a select few figure heads. Fairness at its core.

Does this lean into right or wrong direction?

-------------------------

TrevorLeahy3 | 2024-04-25 20:04:28 UTC | #2

I think the most reliable way to avoid capture of network representatives and channels is to avoid having them. Its the most reliable way to engineer any liability right out of the situation.

The idea to build voting mechanisms and admin elections sound like great ideas for .Org or any pillar brand and its community to apply as a way to self govern.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:06:06 UTC | #3

So how do we tackle the issue of core channels? We cannot have permanent figure heads. We cannot all bid for spots on CMC and high value site listings. It's not the way most of these platforms have been designed. If we put no links, we just make it harder on ourselves.

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-04-25 20:06:28 UTC | #4

We will solve this entire issue, and be so much more effective by sunsetting old channels. Any entity can open their own channel / social account. Based on your skills and resources, I imagine your channels will be amongst the very best.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:08:30 UTC | #5

I disagree, sunsetting is just an excuse to benefit from existing routing paths into their new channel (then they can call themselves the founders and be the figure heads they always wanted to be). Same problem as routing old CMC links. If it gets sunset, there are no backlinks to new communities. Everyone starts from scratch. You really want that the appearance for a user coming from CMC and clicking on the telegram link? Seeing a dead main channel and no direction?

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:09:29 UTC | #6

Bandaids guys, all doing the same thing and not fixing the core problem that a few select people can take advantage of something that was network-owned and originally not theirs.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:12:57 UTC | #7

And the same applies to OG the Zenon_Network handle. It's an OG resource, owned by the network, back linked to high value / high traffic sources. If you want to kill TG, you have to kill the twitter handle and all other channels, with no new links pointing to new resources. That's the fairest way to start from scratch.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:15:25 UTC | #8

Also nothing prevents those channels to be re-launched in some future by the figure heads owning them already, aka TG @0x3639? In-perpetuity should not exist for assets owned by OG Zenon which MANY were here to build. Long before some people showed up.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:16:00 UTC | #9

Read between the lines guys, there is a quest to centralize ownership and power at Zenon. And some obvious figure heads are making that intent very clear.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-04-25 20:25:04 UTC | #10

my preference is to sunset all legacy communication channels established by the founding devs and let the community build new channels.

We could archive TG Main and zenon_twitter.  No one should have the burden of being an "owner" for a legacy community channel.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:27:46 UTC | #11

If sunset it cannot point to new resources. The idea is to sunset all paths actually. What happens to CMC and high-value backlinks? This is a bandaid so that we forget about the problem, a new community is formed elsewhere and then their figure heads once again try to speak on behalf of the entire network. They can even make claims to CMC that they're the new community, without approval of the network as a whole.

This idea just delays the same problem.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:29:24 UTC | #12

Ignoring true network-governance is a huge red flag.

-------------------------

Shen | 2024-04-25 20:35:34 UTC | #13

Assuming we have a governanve module, how do you enforce a democratically elected owner? It is off chain, owner has all the power

-------------------------

Asgardians-Pillar | 2024-04-25 20:42:01 UTC | #14

My zenon AI responds with this after feeding all the data. It seems pretty decent to me. But as I said not really my expertise, just trying.

The governance model suggested by @mehowbrainz brings forward a series of innovative ideas that resonate well with our network’s ethos of decentralization and community-driven development. Here are some thoughts and potential enhancements to further refine the proposal:

1. **Cycled Leadership Positions**: The idea of having rotational roles for admins, maintainers, and other leadership positions is compelling. It encourages diversity of thought and leadership and prevents any form of stagnation or power consolidation. We might consider setting specific criteria and qualifications for these roles to ensure that candidates are well-prepared to serve the community effectively.

2. **Domain Management as a Governance Tool**: Using zenon.community as a high-value traffic router is a strategic use of digital real estate. By allowing it to redirect to various community-approved domains based on election outcomes, we create a dynamic environment where domains must continuously demonstrate value to the community. This could potentially drive higher engagement and innovation across all community platforms.

3. **Balancing Open vs. Closed Source Decisions**: The flexibility to decide whether certain projects or tools should be open or closed source via community votes introduces a pragmatic approach to intellectual property. This could be further improved by guidelines or frameworks that help the community evaluate the implications of these decisions on security, development, and collaboration.

4. **Implementing No Confidence Votes**: The provision for no-confidence votes adds a necessary check within our governance framework, allowing the community to rectify decisions that may not unfold as expected. However, we should define clear parameters for initiating such votes to prevent potential misuse and ensure they are used judiciously.

5. **Managing Voting Fatigue**: To address concerns about overloading the community with frequent decisions, perhaps we could establish a tiered voting system where only decisions meeting certain impact thresholds require full community involvement, while lesser decisions could be handled by randomly selected smaller panels or existing committees.

6. **Expert Consultation**: Bringing in a specialist in web3 political science is a great idea to ensure that the governance structure we adopt is robust, fair, and sustainable. This expert could help draft a detailed governance charter that would include mechanisms for amendments and updates as the network evolves.

This proposal indeed leans in the right direction by prioritizing fairness and continual evolution in our governance practices. I look forward to further refining these ideas with the community and to moving towards a more decentralized and dynamic governance model.

Zenon doesn't follow trends right, it's a pain but we should do anything in our power to be the most decentralized. Because if we are not eventually agents will infiltrate and fuck shit up just like they did with Bitcoin and it's blocksize war.

something that was network-owned
[/quote]

Inaccurate statement. Telegram was owned by Mr. Kaine, then Sigli, then 0x. It was never network-owned. It can't be.

[quote="mehowbrainz, post:7, topic:1878"]
you have to kill the twitter handle
[/quote]

A suggestion was made to preserve the twitter history by freezing the account in time forever. I would do this if I could. However, again, this is not a network owned channel, it's literally owned by Kaine and will transition to another human being, not the network, or get terminated.

Owned by permissions and represent what the network wants, yes. Owned to dictate decisions on behalf of the network, nope.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-04-25 20:45:53 UTC | #17

no rational person would want to "own" or take over TG main after all this. The only logical solution is to sunset it and build new community paths owned by their sponsors.  Kaine would never support what is happening now.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:47:38 UTC | #18

Your word vs another's means nothing. There's centralizing ownership and control issues forming.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-04-25 20:51:19 UTC | #19

I don't have this black and white view. To me, telegram is a resource. It's a public chat. There's bots with links, and human interaction about Zenon occurs. I try to be as helpful as I can to others that come through, and keep conversation as productive and civilized as possible. 

You need to stop seeing this as something were its only useful when it succesfully converts a person into a NoM user, that's not the exclusive use. You are free to create another tg channel for that, and if its that good, we should feature it on CMC, as the intended application of the cmc landing page is to onboard users. 

Therefore, the TG cannot dictate decisions on behalf of the network, it only allows communication about the network.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:54:02 UTC | #20

1. You guys don't understand the value of traffic sources.
2. None of you including me should be permanent maintainers/admins of anything.
3. It is your beliefs that Kaine granted permanent ownership of spaces which belonged to the network. If it wasn't explicitly mentioned by him, it's your assumptions.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-04-25 20:57:51 UTC | #21

1. Probably not as well as you
2. We don't want to be maintainers/admins of the inherited channels. We are only trying to help in this transitory period.
3. It didn't belong to the network. It belonged to Kaine. We could have and people have created and used probably more other channels (i.e Zenon Community). The creators of Zenon Community are in their right to exercise permanent ownership of their tg channel. Zenon is not owned by anyone. We are all free to do the same, even encouraged.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 20:58:32 UTC | #22

3. Then I refuse to be part of a network which has figure heads claiming decisions over the network. The narrative of the value of Pillars has changed over time as these figure heads gained power.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 21:18:33 UTC | #23

All of you who replied ignored to answer why my idea above cannot work.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 21:23:17 UTC | #24

Enforcement is an issue. But the same applies for AZ. We got rekt on some AZ's and lost funds. How can we ask for the funds back?

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-04-25 21:27:34 UTC | #25

What idea? The domain acting as a router? 

My issue with changing hands is we increase the likelihood of getting rugged/handing the domain over to a bad apple. I do like the idea of pointing to what's considered the better resource, but that's a subjective thing, even if we think of some metrics we could use to help make a decision.

Why elections are held.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 21:27:53 UTC | #27

Who says the current owners of zenon.community aren't bad apples? You thought .network wouldn't give up on you, and they sure didn't give a f -- so yeah anyone can be a bad apple.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-04-25 21:28:50 UTC | #28

that's exactly why we should not rely on any domain or single entity, zir.

No elections, no figure heads. No single points of entry for the network.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 21:33:24 UTC | #29

And why not have an election process which keeps everything in place and improves the network?

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 21:34:26 UTC | #30

I think there are more flaws in killing the TG/Twitter, then to implementing a democracy in the existing network and channels. This isn't rocket science.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-04-25 21:44:09 UTC | #31

I'm open to the idea, I do think there will be significant efficiency gains if we are able to come up with something that works. I'm just skeptical we'll achieve any meaningful progress. Keep in mind this problem is not exclusive to us.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-25 21:56:45 UTC | #32

@0x3639 if you don't believe in delegator-weighed Pillar votes for a governance module, why would you think that delegators should discuss proposals in an old OG chat where we were setting up the forum? I get that they're community-too.... but wait.. maybe it has something to do with the fact that you supported the idea of such governance mechanism in the past? Ah yes that's probably it.

I don't appreciate the way in which you are trying to move this conversation forward. It is not productive, it's offensive to contributors and discourages open participation.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-26 14:39:13 UTC | #34

You asked me to move the conversation here, so it's still a conversation.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-04-26 14:40:00 UTC | #35

It's not my fault a bunch of you are offended because I find facts are being fabricated at the moment.

-------------------------

Cheewiee | 2024-04-26 23:56:37 UTC | #36

Let's see, I liked @mehowbrainz suggestions and as I work in marketing the power of backlinks and traffic routing are crucial, I agree. 

An election of voters who have shown their Proof-of-Work and who pay to participate in the network is an excellent idea. 
These elections could be held regularly during times of significant updates to the protocol in general.  

I don't think there's any dichotomy between the community here, just a war of human ego. 

But I support not sunsetting the old channels because they work as backlinks and traffic routes, the old channels should at least become a guide on how to participate in the network from now on using AZ for example. 

deleting the old channels will only lead to more disorganization.

-------------------------

aliencoder | 2024-04-27 12:27:58 UTC | #37

Instead of fighting each other, let's try and come together. This community was built on mutual respect and a shared vision for the values and ethos of Bitcoin. Remember that.

We have AZ for network governance and we should expand it to encompass more than decentralized funding.

We, the community have the power to change things for the better. I'm doing my part. Are you?

-------------------------

romeo | 2024-04-28 12:44:36 UTC | #38

Second what @aliencoder said

Let's be productive please and not try to prove anyone wrong - it seems everyone is on board with voting in a new TG owner.

After that we can discuss what to do with the back links on CMC etc.

-------------------------

romeo | 2024-04-28 21:53:34 UTC | #39

Most "improvement proposal" systems (think ZIPs) usually categorize the proposed governance change which then determines the voting mechanism (on-chain vs general sentiment vs poll etc.).

Obviously we can't be having every decision go to AZ, I don't think that's an effective use of Pillar time and efforts but if there's enough discourse in the community about it then it's the best mechanism we have for ratifying a decision. Bitcoin doesn't perform an on-chain vote for changing the BIP GitHub editors for example - they do it off chain.

In the future I'm sure we'll have an on-chain governance voting and execution solution (think AZ but for governance in its own tab in Syrius) - but for now let's agree as a community on if we need to vote via AZ for the TG owner roles and then the other items that mehowz was raising - we can continue to have that discussion here

-------------------------

romeo | 2024-04-29 00:10:31 UTC | #40

Some good points for discussion on the topic:

(noting GitHub editors are a bit more critical than TG admins etc. but the points are related)

coinselor | 2024-04-29 03:05:18 UTC | #41

So @baggot had a lucid moment tonight. I don't think he realizes it yet, but hear me out I think this solves our short-term issues:

We still leverage AZ:

1 Pillar = 1 Vote

However, we will include delegators by adding their weights off-chain.

15K Weight = 1 Community Vote

This allows all delegators during the AZ voting phase to shift weights to pillars that align with their vote. 

We keep track of all this off-chain, ideally with a visualizer tallying up votes in real time. We'll just need to come to terms for a new quorum that accounts for community votes. 

There are 5,126,415 ZNN delegated. That's about ~340 more votes.

Problem: We will still reach AZ quorum with a low number of pillar participation (~31), but perhaps we can now aim for a larger number of delegated weight participation.

Thoughts?

-------------------------

baggot | 2024-04-29 03:12:29 UTC | #42

sounds good but i want 10% finders fee.

-------------------------

romeo | 2024-04-29 03:19:58 UTC | #43

Issue is there are multiple instances of self delegation with Pillars and no easy way to track that - so in essence it could end up quite skewed and potentially manipulated

There's no risk free approach to having all network participants involved in governance votes at this stage

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-04-29 03:26:40 UTC | #44

If a pillar is self delegating 100K, it should have more than 1 vote in my books, lol. I think no matter how we look at this, it's an improvement.

We are not looking for a perfect system, just a marginal improvement over AZ.

-------------------------

baggot | 2024-04-29 03:25:46 UTC | #45

My idea simply was to use it as a barometer for community sentiment and allow pillars to change strategies or adjust their vote decisions accordingly withan input from community.

-------------------------

romeo | 2024-04-29 04:31:36 UTC | #46

I see your point, just trying to look at it from non -pillar participants point of view also 

I feel a website or snapshot would be a better way of tracking sentiment like that, there's heaps of options and ways to so it but it isn't as sexy as N&T or dynamic plasma etc.

-------------------------
