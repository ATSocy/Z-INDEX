Thread: zenon-storybook-az
zyler9985 | 2024-08-17 21:13:52 UTC | #1

Hey guys. I've been creating content for Zenon for 2 years now, the articles as well as the storybook. The goal being to educate people about Zenon and to present Zenon in a positive light. 

Their reception has been positive, and my performance data is rudimentary, but it shows that when we started pumping about a month ago, my stuff got 200 views in the span of 3 days, and has had another 300 views since then, so I think I contributed to the narrative which helped our recent growth and onboarding new people.

I've been encouraged to seek funding support from the DAO, so I've made this proposal for 5k ZNN and 50k QSR.

EDIT for additional comment:
As for data, personal effort and future value:

I went back over my medium which has 30+ articles of a marketing/educational nature. They have 3850 views combined, which is quite high when you consider how under the radar Zenon is – it’s arguably punching above its weight there. There are also some Twitter metrics to support, so the Storybook had 218 link clicks, 7672 impressions on Twitter. It is about 40% a historical timeline, 20% educational and 20% future roadmap.

All of this content took me many, many hours to make. Easily north of 200 hours which I put in during the bear with a crashed price. The opportunity cost for such an endeavour is heavy.

And I’d like to point out that many of the articles have future value – for example, stuff I wrote earlier in the year helped with the recent pump we had when there was that burst of 500 new views I mentioned. In another 6 months, those same articles will be reread and explain the same things for new people to read.

-------------------------

I encourage ongoing contributions, but I will vote no 5 times with ZenonORG and HyperGrowth Pillars for the following reasons:

* No evidence of content having an impact on growth.
* Your calculated cost per view seem astronomical. The most expensive CPM's probably wouldn't even compare to the rate you're calculating here.

-------------------------

zyler9985 | 2024-01-05 22:35:37 UTC | #3

I respect your position. 

I will make an extra comment shortly to further clarify some things.

But what are views worth if you currently can't prove their effects on price growth or new participation?

I wouldn't ask 5K ZNN 50K QSR for quoting this tweet over and over for it to get 8K views (which maybe converted some users, maybe didn't). With the newly launched Attribute + NoM bridge event integration + static funnels, marketers will be able to prove the value their content drives.

mehowbrainz | 2024-01-05 23:35:40 UTC | #6

Another example: I promoted as a test my blog post re: Taproot. The link click cost was $0.18 per click.

To match your traffic of 3850 views/clicks, I'd have to spend $693.

So the traffic is relatively cheap to buy, why should the network be buying for production at costs of thousands if we don't even know if it's converting participation? 5K ZNN + 50K QSR isn't cheap.

The problem: sometimes people think that content creation = marketing. People want to get paid, but when you ask "okay but how can you prove this spend converts value?" ... *silence*

-------------------------

ChadassCapital | 2024-01-06 02:21:45 UTC | #7

I voted yes and will vote yes with others. I don't care about metrics, I'm a Chad. I encourage contributions. I don't undermine efforts.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-01-06 03:08:47 UTC | #8

5,000 ZNN @ $1.76 = $8,800 USD
50,000 QSR @ 0.176 = $8,800 USD
Total = $17,600 USD

Cost to drive 3850 views = $693.

$17,600 - $693 = $16,907 USD

My ad promoted Taproot blog post cost $2.45 per 1k impressions.

His 7,672 impressions are valued at $18.80 given the same rate.

$16,907 - $18.80 = $16,888.20 USD

$16,888.20 / 200 (his estimated hours) = $84.44 USD per hour or

$16,888.20 / 30 (number of articles estimated) = $562.94 USD per article

My taproot blog post was written for free with GPT, in 15 minutes.

If we forget the cost of production he calculated for himself:

$17,600 / 3850 article views = $4.57 per click. Compared to the $0.18 per click via advertising, his calculated fee is 25.39 times more expensive (if we include the production cost in the whole).

For it to catch up in value to of $0.18 per click, it would take 97,778 organic article views (probably a very long time, since we can't prove the new participation / conversions his articles drive).

What a waste of AZ funds if this gets approved. The whole strategy wasn't thought through. I'm sorry but the network shouldn't accept proposals just because people contribute. Many others contribute (without conversion proof), and likely converted more value than what he's asking-for.

I'm all for contributions, at fair market value though. Undermining is a critical way to say "evaluate". Just doing due diligence on such claims in proposals:

Additional comment: It isn't fair to expect someone to be a specialist at both content creation and distribution; you can pay two people for the two different roles.

I have a critique of a purely data-based approach. Onboarding people requires content creation and gaining exposure. This can be outsourced to two different people. One specialising in content creation (this proposal), then you have your influencers who specialise in giving the content exposure to a *new* audience to create conversions as they have already built an existing following – this is exactly what happened with our recent pump. Those influencers shared my articles and they have gotten 500 views total since the pump, 200 in the span of 3 days – I doubt any of those were from the existing Zenon community. It was new people, the ones buying in and joining telegram. 

As an anecdote, here's how hard it is for one person to wear both hats (content creation and distribution). There's an influencer called Tyler (I swear it's not my main account lol) whose handle is @ApeDurden, he has 94k followers. In 2022 he pinned my game theory for progressive decentralisation article in his private investor group to shill people – but then I checked my Twitter. He never liked or retweeted my post. The play always seems to be quietly accumulate. 

So if my content, even when retweeted by Zenon's main page stays trapped in the bubble of existing holders, and even when influencers discover it they purposely share it in a stealth-like manner, and when I go to funding support from the DAO after 2 years of work, if I'm denied? You can't see how that would be an issue for growing a young, community-run project? Or do we think Zenon's success is guaranteed, and the budget for Growth should therefore be 0% because it will happen anyway? Are you willing to bet your bags on that? Not to mention bet with everything Zenon is trying to achieve? The reality is there is a time-pressure where Zenon has to stay competitive with the rest of the market. The new money from community growth can pay for new devs and so on in a positive feedback loop. Growth is therefore important for Zenon's success and should have an allocation imo.

Thank you for your support.

tapwoot | 2024-01-06 20:04:58 UTC | #12

My math is simple, I voted yes to Shazz's copy paste PDF, so I voted yes for Zyler's 40 articles over a 2 year span that has maintained the Zenon community engagement and keeps the heart beat alive while the community devs continue to work behind the scenes. 

I feel that many in the community are overlooking the value of engaging with and retaining our existing members (which can be seen as a form of customer retention), focusing instead primarily on acquiring new members. 

Both are contributing factors to demand and supply.  Go figure

-------------------------

tapwoot | 2024-01-06 23:36:55 UTC | #14

Alot of Zyler's posts were fresh and innovative content, yours was actually copy and paste from TG lmao. Cry all you want about how much effort it took and how its so much more valueable than other peoples work.  You just look like an entitled baby at this point

You never approached me for voting, you only publicly tried to humilate my pillar on twitter... expecting that to change my mind, when we finally had a reason for you to ask me to vote and for us to move on from our issues.

Piss off with your stupid valuation figores

TrevorLeahy3 | 2024-01-07 02:09:40 UTC | #16

Quality grassroots content being produced from a proven community member for a significant amount of time has to be worth something. 

Im pretty sure the argument has been made in the past that its up to the community maximize the reach and value of this sort of content.

At the rates you're asking, it's expected to have incredible distribution included. I think you haven't done your market research on how much $17.6K is really worth for a pro content creator/marketer (and yes these people exist which can do both). You may not be one of them, that's fine --- but don't try to charge like them.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-01-07 04:10:59 UTC | #24

I echo this. I'd agree to pay $20 per hour tops for such deliverables. But I wouldn't hire him for any of my marketing activities (nor think AZ should pay for any more content) until he develops a better understanding of marketing cycles, strategy or path to conversion -- and learns to use GPT alongside his writing style to produce faster. With the tools we have at our disposal (and more coming soon), we can do incredible things if we listened to one another. I've always been available for guidance for anyone who wanted to learn. I'm not dedicating years of work on performance tools, no critiquing harshly for no reason either. Everything is designed to make everyone better.

What don't you guys should recognize the benefit of a good contribution. You're not running your little own 2000' company with boomers management style. This is another space, with other dynamics. If the contribution was a complete troll I would support your views but this isn't the case and I think you should try to see this as a way to cement a core of OGs contributors rather than a mn opportunity to show your little accounting skills.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-01-07 06:55:40 UTC | #26

My 2000's company boomer management style got .org + attribute + funnel frameworks developed for $17 per hour, at pretty solid dev speeds. It also got me to experiment with new ideas in order to save AZ funds i.e. developing myself GPT tools so I'd never have to think I'd need to bill $17K to write 30 articles.

I can generate a report for the amount of traffic/conversions I generated via Twitter/organic for Zenon (proven with Attribute) and submit a proposal like his. P.S. that wouldn't include any code, that's just production hours ofc. EZ 5k/50K. I'll submit another once I hit 200 hours of production work, just gotta make sure the content stays posted on Twitter so that it keeps driving value for years to come!

Other OGs, feel free to tally up your hundreds of hours of contributions and come up with some arbitrary valuation.

It doesn't make sense. 

What does make sense: @zyler9985 ask for a fair value and resubmit.

zyler9985 | 2024-01-07 09:19:47 UTC | #29

I had a think, and realised I wasn't explaining my efforts properly. Each article takes about 10 hours, unless it's a difficult one that can take a month of struggling with it to understand the concepts, present it well and make it entertaining. And the storybook, not talking about writing it, but each image could take 20minutes or could take 2 hours to generate a suitable image for one chapter, and there were 60 chapters. I'd estimate about 1000 hours of work total over the 2 years but it's not like I was clocking in and clocking off.

To be honest, I was originally going to ask for two AZs, but to make life easy I made a major concession and went in only asking for one. But some are saying that's still too much, and frankly I just want this disappointing ordeal to be over with.

I can make an additional concession and resubmit to ask only for 65% of the 1 AZ, so 5k ZNN and 15k QSR.

- In the US you can work at Chick Filet for $26/hr.  
- In my experience in writing all these articles, ChatGPT can help some but they don't write the articles.  I helped Alien with his last post and ChatGPT actually made it take longer.  There is no way around these articles taking a long time to write.
- I'm afraid focusing on performance metrics as the only measurement of the success of a marketing idea will kill all community ideas.

I think community members should submit AZs for marketing efforts with specific goals in mind and I personally hope they don't need performance metrics to get approved.  For example, someone should submit an AZ to write an investment thesis on NoM.  We have no idea how many people will click on it, read it, or if it will lead to conversion.  And the AZ should not be determined by those metrics IMO.  But I assure you that if we write something like this for NoM it will be valuable.  

I think an article like this will take 40 hours to write.  At 50/hr that's about $2000 USD or 1000 ZNN.  That seems like a fair request to me.

If i had a pillar i'd vote yes on. 
Zyler's contributions are invaluable and the funding he requests is justified given the significance of his work. He is pioneering in documenting our culture and ethics, making it accessible to the wider crypto community.
The storybook itself is worth 5K ZNN. 
Without Zyler who else would have chronicled the history of our network? Understanding our roots is essential for taking part as community member or dev, and his detailed articles of our origin and lore are indispensable. 
Please don't neglect culture, the articles are very useful for newcomers.

This single tweet resulted in over 40k views for one of the zenon decks and likely already paid for the AZ with the subsequent inflow of new capital. This doesn't even take into account the numerous holders I onboarded to zenon via dms, or all the buys generated by zenon.org which built is entire marketing strategy based on the narratives and content I compiled.

Surely you can show how 40 articles merit 5k ZNN beyond just a few hundred views? If not, it is quite concerning if you believe you're the one making a compromise here. It's a shame you've been led to believe you are owed significant gratitude and compensation by some people who repeatedly displayed utter incompetence when assessing marketing related AZs.

I want to emphasize that your efforts have value but you need help to get your content seen in order for it to become valuable. My and @mehowbrainz offer still stands to help you get the attribution needed with zenon.org's tools so you can submit an AZ that, without a doubt, will pass.

We need to be able to determine / justify value of work with logic... submitting 5k / 50k for everything in a bear when ZNN was below $1 is something we must leave in the past. 

Value your work, justify that value, make your ask specific.

-------------------------

zyler9985 | 2024-01-07 13:56:31 UTC | #36

You've been doing great work Shazz. The 500 views I mentioned are actually reads on medium. If we’re talking about impressions, those are in the thousands. But impressions include people who just scroll past it and don’t click anything. That’s why I clarified the storybook had 7600 impressions, but only 220 clicks. So about 3% who scrolled by it actually clicked to read it. I do need help with getting my content seen, all content creators have that issue. The thing people are discussing is the precedent of the deck being initially paid out based on content creation alone.

But Mehowz did make a good point in telegram, about how just because that was the way it was done before, now things have evolved, it can be done differently moving forwards with the newly created tools. Deeznutz also made some good points too though. I'll need to think about it and talk to some people, maybe we can DM a bit too.

[/quote]

Sorry that's false. Many of you still don't get it and I understand why, I will lead by example soon between .Org articles + its static funnels. Hopefully it'll be an "aha moment" for you all. You won't need to use .org branding for basic funnels.

Imagine you write an article, and all your links lead to individual attribute funnels i.e. buy znn, use the bridge etc.

What wasn't killed:

1) You were able to be as creative as you want with your content. As long as it drives readers and traffic to clear goals. I'm open to any and all ideas for content, as long as there's some basic marketing strategy there. It can be discussed via DM anytime.

2) You can measure how successful your content was at driving down some path. Did people go somewhere valuable to the network in the end? Did they swap wZNN > ZNN a few weeks later? All is possible thanks to Attribute. 

What performance-based marketing does is:

- Ask content creators to be narrow in objectives. Are you using your article to introduce Zenon at the awareness stage? What is the purpose of the content?

- Are you using your article to try to lead them down a conversion path directly? What can the network get in return from that reader in order to nurture him?

- Allows you to break down the costs as I outlined above. How much did it cost per view. How much did it cost to get a lead? How much did it cost to get a wZNN>ZNN swap?

Here's the problem: The community isn't trying to learn the value of performance/strategy-based marketing. They want to create content as freely as they want, ask insane amounts (likely more than any seasoned pro in the space for the same type of work), without the responsibility of making sure their work is valuable in the end. They don't want to accept that in this day and age in web, we can be lead with metrics. But that's what you get from a community which has 0 experience in web marketing.

0x3639 | 2024-01-07 18:18:07 UTC | #41

We can agree to disagree.  

We should encourage someone to write an investment thesis on NoM, like multichain did for THORChain. It will take 40+ hours and that time is worth something.  We should pay for that time, regardless of the number of clicks it generates or conversions it creates.  And I think many other pillars would support this given my discussions with them.

And, I believe we should encourage people to make AZs that do not include perfect marketing execution.  We are in the FAFO stage.  And I think we should try some FAFO marketing.  

IRL, I market the lease of apartment units.  We use google ad words, ILS, and several syndication sources.  We can track leads and where they come from, but I cannot track with 100% certainty every lead, the source, and who signed a lease per source.  That technology requires a team to implement and manage.  Regardless, I've managed to sign thousands of leases with my subpar marketing and I can make ad spend decisions based on my shitty systems.  The incremental time and money required for perfection FAR exceed the cost of the marketing itself.  So I do some shotgun marketing b/ it cheaper and easier to manage.  

Setting this aside, I'm not saying that I support Zyler's AZ.  But I do think the current environment around marketing AZ is not conducive to anyone wanting to market this project.

I disagree, we have enough new tools to actually lead towards performance. Just because people don't want to learn how (but they're OG's), doesn't mean we have to accept their work.

Step 1: They have to realize that there's talent in the community building towards performance, and his tools and time is available to all willing to learn a thing or two. A content creator is not a marketer. It's simply a segment of the overall mix to claim you successfully marketed a brand. That's why most of the influencers out there in any market, are usually just pure affiliates. They promote products, which have funnels/purchase flows designed by marketers (who can then nurture the lead the influencer brought in). Article writing is an equivalent subset, but when he doesn't have an audience other than the current followers, can you really compare him to influencer level which may have an audience? No. Do you see how many skills are missing to value this at the rate he asked? Content strategy to drive a conversion for the network, distribution audience (flows/funnels will be offered by Attribute soon) all are part of the value mix, and it's missing.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2024-01-07 18:34:17 UTC | #45

Devaluing performance will only make performant marketers and their future proposals more expensive if the community wants to set low benchmarks as the standard. Might be good for me, just saying it now.

I think Zyler's work is worth $20 per hour for the effort.

I appreciate the enthusiasm we're displaying towards this proposal. It stands out for several reasons: zyler's involvement, the proposal's timing, and our history of proposals. I believe that having an in-depth discussion on establishing standards for marketing-specific proposals will greatly benefit us in the long run.

Since @mehowbrainz joined our ecosystem, his grasp of marketing concepts and vision for a performance metrics-based marketing framework have been evident. Personally, I have been interested in enhancing my marketing skills. After reaching out to him, he shared some valuable resources and books. Consequently, I have been diligently studying Marketing.

I would like to highlight a concept that demonstrates how both @0x3639 and @mehowbrainz can be simultaneously correct, despite their differing approaches. In Seth Godin's book "This is Marketing", he distinguishes between Direct Marketing and Brand Marketing.

Brand marketing focuses on building trust and awareness for your brand, and its impact is largely unquantifiable. In contrast, Direct Marketing aims to prompt specific actions (like clicks, impressions, purchases) and its effectiveness is entirely measurable.

Our website footer states "Built by the Community." If we aim to establish a brand around this concept, all community contributions (like zyler's articles and development updates) can be leveraged in Direct Marketing (which is quantifiable) and also enhance our brand, providing immense yet unmeasurable value to our ecosystem.

Furthermore, contributors should consider another important aspect. Your contributions, depending on their nature, might not only benefit the community but also build equity in your personal brand. While not everyone can contribute code that gets merged into our zenon-network repository, consider the example of ZenonHub. As Zenon succeeds, ZenonHub, with its headstart as an explorer, is likely to become more feature-rich than its competitors, adding substantial value to the ZenonHub brand. This is similar to the value etherscan has accrued. The same principle applies to individual marketers building personal brands or Zenon.info evolving into a professional publication, and so on.

I strongly side with SultanOfStaking's take, in that my issue personally is supporting another proposal for the maximum amount. The equation is not as simple as how much time the contributor has sinked into the proposal times how  much he/she values his/her time. I hope that by my remarks in this post, you can appreciate it that  It's a lot more complicated than that, and we should negotiate and come to an agreement hence why we believe all contributors should start the discussion as early as possible when funds will be requested for work delivered.

I like what you do @zyler9985 but I think this request is too much and the amount should be reconsidered. At this point in time I don't think spending this much of the treasury on this type of content is justified.

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-11 06:12:56 UTC | #48

I think the request is completely valid and no need to be reconsidered. Maybe when there is 10,000 active network members, then reconsideration for amount might be required. At this current stage of the project it is a 100% valid request imo.

# Resubmission on Zyler's behalf: Supporting Valuable Contributions by @zyler9985 

Dear Zenon Community,

We’re revitalizing Zyler9985's AZ proposal with a new resubmission, recognizing the immense value of his contributions. Previously, some of us voted NO due to the max request, but after further reflection, it's clear we must correct this stance. Supporting valuable work is essential for the growth and success of our network.

Zyler's 40 articles and comprehensive storybook have significantly strengthened our brand and community ethos, contributing to our growth in ways beyond mere metrics. His content provides foundational knowledge and engages users, laying the groundwork for onboarding new members and developers.

**DeezNutz and I are taking the initiative and resubmitting a new AZ on behalf of Zyler. We acknowledge the substantial value of Zyler's work and believe it deserves recognition and support.**

It's time to change our approach to hypergrowth. The AZ fund must support valuable contributions to ensure continued progress. Therefore, we propose 5,000 ZNN and 50,000 QSR to Zyler for his two years of work. Let's set the right precedent: **the network pays when value is created.**

Support this AZ and pay Zyler for the valuable work he created. For more details on the logistics and community escrow chosen, please [read the full proposal](https://www.greenpill.pro/grass-roots-marketing-az)

Thank you for your continued support and engagement.

Retake the green pill :point_down:

*In the past six months, I've realized that turning down Zyler's contributions actually harms Zenon more in the long run than protecting AZ funds. I hope we can come together as a community to correct this mistake.*

mehowbrainz | 2024-07-23 22:53:37 UTC | #50

I quote my message on [Telegram](https://t.me/zenonnetwork/372537):

> Imma post a bunch of pricings from media kits soon — you’ll see why content alone without distribution cannot be worth 5K + 50K QSR. 

> Quick example: A newsletter campaign with one of the major sources can cost around $2800 ($10 CPM), that’ll be sent out to 280K readers, 35% will open so 98K. So you know you’ll get 98K reads for that cost. Then 0.7% will open a link in the newsletter article (this drives down into whichever site — aka funnel but these people don’t get that a funnel is nothing more than a symbolic term to represent a path down a journey of discovery until participation is proven — even JP from THORChain who was against marketing terms started to use funnel in his latest meme strat lingo, just saying Deez you really gotta up your game here, poking doesn’t work). So at 0.7% clicks, you may get 686 clicks.

> Value driven from the $2.8K = 98,000 reads of your Zenon content and 686 clicks down any link to discover any site (funnel).

> Regardless of the quality of his content. As a whole, did they generate 98,000 reads to new potential participants? Or was his content shared around Zenon bag holders?

> This is a data-driven game whether you like it or not.

> I have no issues with paying for content like I always said, but it should be coupled with a decent distribution strategy. My vote would be to repurpose his content into sponsored content on a variety of sources (I compiled a bunch), and pay Zyler a fraction of the fee he asked + spend the funds on distribution like mentioned above. This’ll give him a pathway to participate with new content again that’s actually being distributed properly to audiences. I’m open to collaborating with Zyler 2.0 if he wishes-to. My votes would forego the conversion aspects but it would be very helpful to put in a new bridge redirect link (soon testing with sumamu) somewhere there so you can get soooome metrics if new participation occurs eventually (I can help with setting UTM parameters in it). I can’t expect too much.

> P.S. I didn’t vote to be part of any Pillar Alliance (was on vacation). I’ll always argue what’s right or wrong for the network’s AZ.

If the AZ is just to pay him for the sake of paying him, then I'm voting no again. I invite you @0x3639 @coinselor to pay him out of your rewards and then create new network value with his content if you so believe in it, in its current format and distribution method.

My motto going forward with AZ: If I personally wouldn't pay for a deliverable myself (due to costs, risks, value, quality, need and ability to create value for myself or the network) -- then I don't think AZ should pay for the deliverable either.

"Put your money where your mouth is".

The network has to be careful in setting the right precedents, again. I've got plenty of stuff I spent a ton of time on which I could "claim" delivered value for the network, would love to submit those bills with an expectation to be paid, because they were pretty, sounded right, accurately reflected the network etc.

If my marketing campaigns fail I won't submit an AZ to claim back funds for my efforts. I'll swallow the pill and try again with a new approach. Learning pains of developing solutions of value for the network.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-07-24 01:22:33 UTC | #51

Not all marketing can be valued in clicks and conversions.  So we will agree to disagree.

I can tell you that after almost three years working on this project I only recently started to understand it after reading all 40 articles. We cannot get this information from .network, .info or .org.  No where close.  And the information is not in the forums or TG. 

Zyler wrote a 40 article bible on the past, present and future of Zenon Network.  Just because that does not convert into clicks and buys today does not mean it's not valuable work.

For example, is the CEX integration software not valuable because we are only using it on XeggeX and the volume is almost nothing?  No.  The software will be used in the future, just like Zyler's articles.

Or, should someone be compensated to complete this [task](https://forum.zenon.org/t/cex-fundraiser-open-until-may-3rd-2024/1860/69?u=0x3639) posted by Alien?  It creates no measurable clicks, conversions or buys today but logic says it will be helpful in the future.  IMO someone should submit an AZ to do this work.

-------------------------

aliencoder | 2024-07-24 09:48:50 UTC | #52

I support @zyler9985 because we've collaborated in the past on some articles and he was truly dedicated to this project.

I also understand @mehowbrainz point of view and I think we can reach a compromise with several conditions for the final payout:

- improve the content with ChatGPT (small revisions where it's necessary)
- repost all the long content (articles) on [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) instead of Medium (that is becoming more confined and centralized)
- repost all the short content on [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) and [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) instead of Twitter/X
- repost most interesting reads on Reddit (on several subreddits)

This way the content will get indexed better and it will be way easier to create conversions/funnels out of it.

[quote="aliencoder, post:52, topic:1745"]

[/quote]

His content is likely already indexed by major search engines. Sorry man, but this is an inexperienced take. I don't think any of those platforms will drive him 100k organic reads anytime soon. Everyone who's doing it properly in the industry, pays for quality visibility/placement.

My votes include:

- Repurposing the content into channels of visibility: different platforms are not the answer. We need to place the content in traffic sources, and those are often paid and provided by publications which actually know how to drive traffic to audiences.
- Shape it around one of the many Zenon brands floating around the community, depending on the content chosen. Direct traffic from the sponsored article into websites/funnels/calls for participation.

I'm going to do the above with my tools regardless if he's in the picture or not. I appreciate @zyler9985's efforts, but there should've always been a better plan for distribution rather than organic / Zenon echo chamber. I think the AZ is better spent on traffic acquisition as mentioned above, the content nowadays can be easily created with the breadth of developments and narratives created by community.

-------------------------

tapwoot | 2024-07-24 19:51:01 UTC | #54

Nobody has bothered to create ongoing content in the community like @zyler9985.

I support this proposal because I wish to reward the early contributors so they can continue to keep the community alive while all the tech is built in the background.  Contributors are rare and we shouldn't turn them all away, especially if they are doing the work first as concept proofs.

It's an alternative to the boring forums in his own unique style which should not be measured by conversions, but more of a historical documenting of events proposal, Zenon Lore

I hope you find the time to read his work @mehowbrainz

-------------------------

sultanofstaking | 2024-07-25 01:27:23 UTC | #55

I think alien has some good suggestions. I have always said I think Zyler deserves something, but his ask just needs to be more specific w/ some parameters around value. I am left wondering 2 things... 1. why doesnt zyler just resubmit himself? 2. what does approval mean? Does zyler come back and contribute again, or are we just paying because we feel bad about how the first round went down?

Ultimately i think these decisions (spending AZ funds on behalf of the community) should be based on sound logic not feelings but that is just my preference. I will likely abstain or vote no unless zyler himself actually engages in this convo - and I hope he does.

-------------------------

Slimy | 2024-07-25 04:43:33 UTC | #56

Man idk- the price of 5k Znn and 50k QSR is too steep, arbitrary, and doesnt sit right. 

Zyler's AZ proposal was in fact the first one the AZ pillars approved and funded! Wasn't it 100znn + 5k QSR for 3 articles?

So basically a rate of 200znn or 2000QSR (6000/3) per article (if we stick with the 1:10 peg).

Continuing the math:
40 articles X 200= 8000znn or 80K qsr.
Subtract the 3 articles already paid for and you have 7400znn or 74K qsr.

If the pillars are inclined to vote yes then they should maintain this same rate of consistency or provide proper reasoning for now opting to award the max ask. Ofc if they feel so strongly they are welcome to always choose to bridge the gap out of their own pockets/emissions.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2024-07-25 11:46:29 UTC | #57

Fully agree. To top it off, this AZ was already voted on and rejected for obvious reasons. If some pillars feel so inclined to compensate Zyler for his work, they can just donate the ZNN to him? After all the shit people here gave me for my AZ which went through proper due process, I find it hilarious that the very same people are advocating to just ignore/subvert an AZ vote and blatantly show double standards. 

Then again, who cares. It's not like AZ is worth anything, so might as well pay the man to stop wasting everyone's time with this.

-------------------------

oginotvavra | 2024-07-25 12:52:37 UTC | #58

amen to Shaz/Mehowz/Sultan´s comments..

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-07-25 19:10:59 UTC | #59

Thank you for this feedback.  I propose the following adjustment to the AZ.  We would make it a minimum request under the assumption Zyler needs to resubmit  himself and engage with us here.  Also note, this says Brat proposes this but I have not asked him about this change yet.  I hope he agrees, and if not, let's keep working the language.  If someone wants to propose a change => PRs are open

In case there is any question about the volume of work... here are the articles.

Who in this community has the time and understanding to actually write the past, present and future of NoM.  Have the detractors actually read every article in here.  I challenge anyone who actually cares and knows about this project to read these articles and emerge without learning a lot.  

I'm curious, why do we pay for code that might or might not be used in the future?

Regarding Zyler's AZ I hope he comes here to engage with the community so he can work on reforming and resubmitting an AZ.  

- Maybe he can work to improve greenpill.me to tell a better story?  Maybe it has a buy button or join TG or something we can measure clicks?
- Maybe he can work on a different distribution method?
- Maybe we can work on turning some articles into short form for different forms of distribution.  

Lot's of options here.  It's up to @zyler9985 to make an effort so we can support his work.  [$DODO](https://medium.com/@baylor10869/beware-dodo-the-black-swan-4971aa34a05f) memes are retarded BTW.  He should GTFO of that space.

Would love to see him define the audience he's reaching to see if it can be matched up in a quality distribution channel / establishment to drive visibility.

Stark | 2024-07-30 23:52:58 UTC | #66

The request is for 10 ZNN / 100 QSR.

Considering how passionate Zyler was about Zenon, I imagine his exit was resolute. While I understand the desire to get back together, it's not often possible to turn back time, after love is lost. Considering that Zyler isn't even responding to messages, I don't see any reason to believe the flame will be rekindled. 

Each person has to make the right decisions for themselves. This project is extremely challenging and I'm not so sure that it's wise or compassionate to invite him to return. Considering the current PA, he made a good exit and I hear that he has moved on to other endeavors. 

Above all, I warmly welcome participants and contributors, old and new, alike.

With that stated, I am voting yes in support of the work and efforts of 0x and Coinselor. Their dedication and contributions are invaluable, and I wholeheartedly support their commitment and spirited work.
