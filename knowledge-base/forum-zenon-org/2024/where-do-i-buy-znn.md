buy on pancake swap then bridge over to mainnet
https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0x84b174628911896a3b87fa6980d05dbc2ee74836&outputCurrency=wbnb

in general, you can find where to buy coins by going to coingecko.com, searching the coin, then clicking 'markets', and it will link to the CEX's/DEX's that trade
