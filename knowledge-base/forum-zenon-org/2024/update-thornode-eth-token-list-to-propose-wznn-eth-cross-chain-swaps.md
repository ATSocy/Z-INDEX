Thread: update-thornode-eth-token-list-to-propose-wznn-eth-cross-chain-swaps
mehowbrainz | 2023-06-14 16:37:48 UTC | #1

Is anyone interested in submitting a PR to the THORNode ETH Token List so that the wZNN.ETH pair can appear for all THORChain interfaces? [TrustWallet, THORSwap, XDEFI, THORWallet, ASGARDEX, Shapeshift, Rango, Unizen, DefiSpot](https://thorchain.org/swap) etc? We'd be able to promote cross-chain swaps into wZNN.ETH (via dex the aggregation/routing feature).

https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/blob/develop/common/tokenlist/ethtokens/eth_mainnet_V101.json

Interfaces which list the token:

:white_check_mark: [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0xb2e96a63479c2edd2fd62b382c89d5ca79f572d3) (no cross-chain)
:white_check_mark: [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/simple/swap/USDT/wZNN) (no cross-chain)

Yes, though maybe after we've settled our bridge/liquidity situation.
Sometime next month?

I replied to that comment. What can I do next to move this forward?

Let me see if I can get someone to intro you to him in Discord.
