Let's discuss Finance related priorities for the next 12 months. These priorities will become active open projects which'll get listed on zenon.org and #marketing teams will be campaigning to attract the necessary talent to complete these priorities. In this Staging sub-category, a new topic will be kept open for each of these priorities to funnel applicants and create a space for conversation.

- [Market Making on STEX](https://forum2.zenon.org/t/market-making-on-stex/1164/7)
- Provisioning liquidity pools (topic pending)
- Arbitraging bots (topic pending)
- [CEX listings](https://forum2.zenon.org/t/cex-listing-applications/829/17)
- Aggregator integrations (topic pending)
- and more...

Before a project is staged into the "Forum | Staging" subcategory, it'll require discussion/voting in this topic.
