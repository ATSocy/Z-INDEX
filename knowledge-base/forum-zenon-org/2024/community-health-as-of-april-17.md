anonymous = viewing the site without a user ID
crawler = google, bing.... crawling the website for search

I'll add it after we're done with the zenon.org app migrations to new infra. Finishing zenon.org atm, will do attribute next.

Discord has an inbuilt linkage method, if you are logged in and press the share button on a post it will append your username in the URL for tracking (I think it watches # of visits).

Obviously pretty basic in comparison, but can give a simple indication of who's links brings in visits
