 I have made a huge mistake while fucking around in Syrius.. it has been a long time since I've been on the network and I acceidentally burned ~3K QSR while looking through the Pillars tab (I thought it would prompt that I didnn't have enough QSR for the pllar.)

My QSR is completely gone :(

Hello,
It looks like you were able to retrieve the QSR: [wallet link](https://zenonhub.io/explorer/account/z1qpp32t3uctrelxpwdq9wrz8avh0njpsvcy8ewc). I don't see a burn tx.

Is everything okay now?
