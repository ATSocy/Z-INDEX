**Project Name:** Zenon Documentation -> docs.zenon.network

**Description:** A professional, clean documentation for NoM **users**, **node runners** and **developers**.

**Explain why your project is vital to the success of Zenon, both in the short and long term?**

Every successful project has a clean, comprehensive documentation to onboard users, node runners and developers. All the information about NoM in a single place.

**URL:** The repo will initially be hosted on **AliensZone** [organization](https://github.com/alienszone). 

**Team:** @aliencoder @0x3639 
------

**Phases**

**Phase 1**

Write the documentation.

Completion of Phase 1 will be measured by:

* Delivering the documentation

**Phase 2**

Proof-reading the documentation.

Completion of Phase 2 will be measured by:

* Moving the documentation to the official Github repository.

-----

 **Funding**

**Total Requested Funding** = 5000 ZNN and 50000 QSR
**Project Duration** = 2 weeks

**Project and Payment Milestones:**
**Phase 1**
Funding Request: 50% (2500 ZNN and 25000 QSR)
Duration: 10 days

**Phase 2**
Funding Request: 50% (2500 ZNN and 25000 QSR)
Duration: 4 days

-------

**Other Information**

**Risks, Assumptions, Known Issues, Dependencies:** What are the variables and dependencies? Do you have contingency plans for significant assumptions, variables, and dependencies?

No external dependencies.

**Have you previously submitted a proposal (either in Accelerator-Z or Incubator)?**

Several projects so far, all of them approved and paid out.

Why is this worth 5000 ZNN and 50000 QSR?
Phase 2, currently valued at ~$3500, is a matter of forking a repo and setting up the docs subdomain.

Hell yeah, thanks for this.

Are you proposing you can do it for cheaper and of the same standard?  Cos I'd be interested to know how much sir?

-------------------------

sbf | 2024-08-13 19:42:33 UTC | #5

I'm not proposing anything. If I wanted to do this work, I'd have already submitted my bid.
As for standards, aliencoder has not demonstrated the quality of the documentation so we'd be speculating about whose work would be better. I'm not interested in that. 

Look, the scope is somewhat vague and the second phase is... grifty.
All I'm asking is why should this be worth a sentinel today.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2024-08-13 20:03:44 UTC | #6

Why wouldn't it?

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-08-13 20:21:54 UTC | #7

What if the full project was submitted as one phase for 5000/50000?

-------------------------

TheDev1776 | 2024-08-13 20:50:02 UTC | #8

Easy yes

You've missed proof-reading.

I'll include anyone that wants to join (I'm inviting @0x3639 @cryptocheshire @Stark @mehowbrainz) to proof-read the documentation and I'll happily share the second phase with active contributors.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2024-08-14 05:42:29 UTC | #10

As much as I'd like to help, code is alien language to me. But I know that other aliens need to be able to interpret it to make it easier to build on zenon

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-08-14 13:33:40 UTC | #11

If there are tutorials or any general copy, I will be happy to contribute and support, by offering proofreading and bridging gaps that may not be obvious to beginner or intermediate users.

Thanks for taking on this long overdue but critical task!

First step to on boarding the next 10,000 devz.

Unfortunately.. we really needed a single place for all NoM related info.

Both user and developer onboarding is the focus of this documentation. Even 100x less onboarded devs  than what you say will make a difference.

I'd be happy to contribute once the bulk is done:

- I have my own internal documentation for orchestrator, supernova and pillar operations, would be nice to compare and improve. I rewrote my own supernova documentation for better clarity on steps, as it's a tricky and detailed process.

- I can link to the docs as the main community-maintained source from zenon.org / funnels.

No payment is required to me @aliencoder
