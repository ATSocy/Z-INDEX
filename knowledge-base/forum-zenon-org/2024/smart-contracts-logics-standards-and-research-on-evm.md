Did you guys saw the work done by the ethOS team on upgradable smart contracts ? I don't know if this is relevant in the case of the NoM but it might be interesting for us: https://docs.ethos.wiki/ethereansos-docs/

I was part of this project and sold early but still looking at what they do from time to time. Maybe there are stuffs we can borrow from them.

I like the idea of [guilds](https://docs.ethos.wiki/ethereansos-docs/guilds/guilds-learn).

Seems very similar to the concept of DAO of DAOs. I like that every subDAO has its own vault.
