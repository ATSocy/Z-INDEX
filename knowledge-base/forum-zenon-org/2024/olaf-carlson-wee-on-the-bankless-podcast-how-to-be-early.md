I listened to this 2X today.  It’s one of the best podcasts on crypto that I have listened to in a LONG time.  This guy invested in about every major project early - before everyone else.  Total animal. 2 take aways:

- read white papers and test the product before investing.  DYOR and think independently.  Don’t listen to others.  Do the fucking work yourself.
- don’t trade crypto.  Buy and hold long term

So many good take aways that apply to this proejct.  No discussion of Zenon, but it’s the type of project I think he would like.
