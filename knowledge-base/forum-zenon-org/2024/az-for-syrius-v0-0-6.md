**Project Name:** 
SYRIUS v0.0.6 Improvements

**Description:** 
This update is momentous in Zenon's history, marking the first time community developers collaborated to produce a release since the wallet was open-sourced.
For over six months, the team implemented new features, added bugfixes, supplied resources, and spent many hours discussing and testing solutions.

The developers have agreed to submit one AZ for all the time and effort they put into this release, and this proposal does not include [Aliencoder's Github Actions](https://forum2.zenon.org/t/az-github-actions-on-all-zenon-network-repos-various-fixes/1360).

**Funding**

**Total Requested Funding** = 4,500 ZNN and 45,000 QSR
**Current Market Value** = $9,000 - $18,000
**Project Duration** = >6 months


**How did you calculate your budget?** 
This AZ covers on-boarding and development times, cost of testing resources, and opportunity cost.
Every team member had to spend dozens of hours learning the codebase without any documentation and mostly in isolation.
Each developer persisted through the barrier to entry, committed additional time identifying areas of improvement, and delivered solutions.

We will be requesting one payout for the full amount and dividing the amount among ourselves.

It has been quite the collaborative task to get to this point- thank you all your efforts. I don't have a pillar to case a vote but  ![image|192x262](upload://cEycXuUWT5HOURIRfzJNhCyWKK7.jpeg)
