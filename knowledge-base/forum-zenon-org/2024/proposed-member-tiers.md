Member Tiers – trust levels from @romeo 

0 (new) → 1 (basic) → 2 (member) → 3 (regular) → 4 (leader)

0-new user: can create topics. Promotion after viewing 5 topics, 30 posts read and 10mins reading

1-basic user: can edit wiki, send PMs. Promotion after viewing 20 topics, 100 reads and 60mins reading, visiting over 15 calendar days, 1 like received, 1 like given, 3 topics replied to

2-member, can invite members. Promotion after 100 days, 50 days total visited, 10 replies, 25 topics created, 500 views etc. etc.

3-regular: can make own wiki. Promotion via visiting 50% of days and being very active in viewing/replying

4-leader: can PM via email. Promotion is manual

Currently trust level 1 is default for new members and invited members. It’s a good way to reward those who participate and help others. If the same model were to apply to the Telegram groups for example the ones that are always active/helping would be level 3 and 4
