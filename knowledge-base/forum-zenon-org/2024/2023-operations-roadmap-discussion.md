Let's discuss Operation related priorities for the next 12 months. These priorities will become active open projects which'll get listed on zenon.org and #marketing teams will be campaigning to attract the necessary talent to complete these priorities. In this Staging sub-category, a new topic will be kept open for each of these priorities to funnel applicants and create a space for conversation.

- Decide which roles could be placed on A-Z payroll (topic pending)
- Organize Discord and Twitter Spaces (topic pending)
- and more...

Before a project is staged into the "Forum | Staging" subcategory, it'll require discussion/voting in this topic.
