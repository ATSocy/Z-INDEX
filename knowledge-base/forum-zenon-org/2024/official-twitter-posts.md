Hello Marketing Team!

Mr Kaine has created a pipeline for us to submit tweets that can be posted by the official account.

Here's the project: https://github.com/zenon-network/twitter

I encourage you all to sign up for Github accounts in order to provide feedback on proposed tweets.
Or define a reviewing process through some other channel.

We can also ask Mr Kaine to enable the Discussions option for that project if you want to collaborate entirely on Github.

In this thread, please suggest ideas for the first community-sourced [@Zenon_Network](https://twitter.com/Zenon_Network) tweet.

Let me know if you need any assistance with Github.

-------------------------

sumamu | 2023-07-28 14:27:59 UTC | #2

We could start with a retweet.

-------------------------

sol | 2023-07-28 14:44:22 UTC | #3

That's possible, too.
https://github.com/marketplace/actions/twitter-together#advanced-tweeting

I was hoping we'd make an announcement.

Here are a few that I generated with Chat GPT:

wot about the thread idea i had? that got the most community engagement. next weekend was gonna post it assuming ppl submit ... as the first community tweet, that would literally reflect the community. the gpt single tweeters above is just more of the same? it's missing an opportunity imo. 

in saying that, no one has even sent their submission yet, so maybe my hope wasnt realistic.

-------------------------

zyler9985 | 2023-07-28 15:29:40 UTC | #6

it's not gonna happen, im being as idealistic as lisa simpson. just go ahead with it. we will do the thread another time.

[/quote]

May you point me to the idea? I missed it.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2023-07-28 16:21:13 UTC | #12

Zyler's original idea:

Zenon twitter and repo is being opened up, this is a historic passing of the torch moment and a major milestone in our commitment to open-source ethos. 
I thought it‚Äôs a good idea to have a distinctive first tweet to mark this occasion. It could be something witty about congress testifying about aliens, but that doesn‚Äôt feel poetic enough

To really reinforce that the Great Wall has fallen, and it is now fully a community project, I think the first tweet should be a thread. Each comment in the thread can be from a different community member. As long as it‚Äôs a popular comment and fits within a decided theme. Theme could be what you love about zenon or why you‚Äôre here, or an anecdote or memory about zenon 
I‚Äôd like to see say 10 tweets in a thread like this, but no need to limit it to 10 if we keep getting great submissions

Just @ me or @ deeznutz and post it in one of the telegram community chats
Maybe next weekend we will post it üëΩ

---

This is way better for the first tweet. Could be a thread quoting aliens or could be a single tweet and then aliens populate the replies. Maybe instead of 10 comments for the thread, we just add 3 from the main tweet account and invite all aliens to participate.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2023-07-28 16:21:25 UTC | #13

Testimonials are always good. I'd vote for @zyler9985's idea.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2023-07-28 16:50:25 UTC | #14

is X adding the ability to gift twitter blue to @zenon_network? I'm gonna guess we can't subscribe to twitter blue through the github actions API :sweat_smile:

Would be nice to increase 280 character length for something like this, plus the extra reach benefits, etc.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-07-28 17:27:08 UTC | #15

What if we want to engge in meaningful twitter convos rather than just shout into a void?

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2023-07-28 17:28:24 UTC | #16

Good observation. Does the new tooling allow us to engage with specific tweets?

-------------------------

sol | 2023-07-28 17:31:46 UTC | #17

[We can](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/twitter-together#advanced-tweeting) reply to specific tweets, retweet, quote tweet, upload images, create polls and threads.

-------------------------

zyler9985 | 2023-07-28 17:41:40 UTC | #18

So we're doing the thread then? I was hoping next saturday post it. Gives time to submit their testimonials, and I'll also chase people down in tg over the course of the week.

Theme is why you're here with zenon, or what you love about zenon, or a memory/anecdote ... that sort of thing. Share what resonates with you, I'd like to see a mix of things. I'll post my one here, and throughout the week I'll keep adding people's submissions to this thread as I get them, or just post them here. Remember to test the twitter character limit to make sure it can be posted with quotation "" as well as your username attribution.

"I got into crypto because I wanted more fiat ‚Äì now I want less fiat. Zenon's mystery, friends and cypherpunk ethos inspire me every day. Normies don't realise it, but there's quiet superheroes out there working hard for a better world."
‚Äì Zyler

-------------------------

sumamu | 2023-07-28 17:45:45 UTC | #19

I was suggesting a retweet to begin with so that we can test if it actually works.

-------------------------

zyler9985 | 2023-07-28 17:50:31 UTC | #20

We will have better memes if we do it without testing ... but im probably the wrong guy to ask. I was advocating for an entire bitcoin to be used when testing the first atomic swap. Live life on the edge and all.

-------------------------

sol | 2023-07-28 17:52:44 UTC | #21

0x and I have tested the repo.
Mr Kaine [assured us](https://github.com/zenon-network/twitter/issues/1#issuecomment-1654504226) the Twitter side is setup.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-07-28 18:00:13 UTC | #22

What's the time from tweet submission to actual post? Is there an "SLA"?

-------------------------

sol | 2023-07-28 18:01:12 UTC | #23

As soon as the post is pulled into the main branch, the Github workflow runs and posts the tweet.
Takes less than 10 seconds.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-07-28 18:03:02 UTC | #24

How long until the post is pulled on the main branch? Is someone monitoring PRs 24/7?

Asking because if we spot a relevant convo and it takes 3 days to get a reply out, this won't work.

-------------------------

sol | 2023-07-28 18:04:59 UTC | #25

0x and I are monitoring, but I don't know who has permission to pull anything in.

Apart from 0x, who else has contributor status for that repo? @mehowbrainz?
If two people approve a tweet, we might have the ability to pull it into the repo.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-07-28 18:09:00 UTC | #26

Can we have an option that is less "alienating" in terms of wordiness and (sorry) slightly cringe alien theme, and instead focuses more on the key messaging around "If Satoshi built feeless ethereum, this would be it"?

Personally I tuned out as soon as I saw alien emojis and 6-7 lines of text.

Less is more. Always.

-------------------------

sol | 2023-07-28 18:09:50 UTC | #27

Everyone is welcome to submit tweets for review.

-------------------------

sol | 2023-07-28 18:13:37 UTC | #28

You can dislike my post. I'm just trying to get this conversation started.

Personally, I don't want to focus my time and energy on marketing and crafting Twitter posts.
But it's obvious to me that someone needs to help the community embrace this new functionality.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-07-28 18:14:20 UTC | #29

Here's mine then:

"If Satoshi built feeless Ethereum, what would it look like"?

There's no reason broadcasting the fact who maintains the twitter account - nobody outside our echo chamber cares. 

If we must announce the handover, put out something short and crisp like "Zenon is a community project, including this twitter account. It's what Satoshi would've wanted."

I'm not trying to be a toxic cunt here - rather an opinion from a professional biz dev used to market to an audience of millions.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-07-28 20:13:48 UTC | #30

[/quote]

For the sake of my own bag, here's my version of this, lmfao. I had to do some magic given the 280 character limit.

@zenon_network shift to community-led marks a milestone in our open-source ethos journey. 'Leaderless,' once a puzzling concept, whispered by critics. 'They'll never surrender control or accept our pull requests,' they said. Yet, here we are, proving them wrong."

---

I strongly believe we MUST use a thread, we can't make justice to what we want to communicate with just 280 characters. Enjoy this longer version of the same content:



A testament to the profound shift in power, Zenon's transformation to a fully community-led project marks a milestone in the journey of open-source ethos. Here's the first of a thread that will serve as a tribute to our collective dedication and commitment:

"Leaderless. A concept that has puzzled, perplexed and often alienated since inception. It has been the echo in the vast expanses of our shared digital universe, a word whispered by critics, cynics and doubters alike. 'They will never surrender control of the keys', they said. 'They will never accept the community's pull requests', they proclaimed. 'They will never...'

But as we stand here today, having torn what just seems like one more small brick in the Great Wall that separated the creators from the community, we beg to differ. This is not an abdication, but rather a proclamation of trust in our shared vision, the vision that Zenon was born from and is fuelled by.

There are those who still think Mr. Kaine will never fade into our cherished memories. But let us not forget, Zenon was never about a single individual. It was, is and will always be about us, the community, the collective. As we navigate through this open-source odyssey, let us embrace the leaderless philosophy not as an obstacle, but as an opportunity.

And to those who doubted, we have but one thing to say - Welcome to the dawn of a new era. An era where we become the architects of our own future. Welcome to the era of Zenon, now truly of the community, by the community, for the community."

-------------------------

sol | 2023-07-28 19:25:04 UTC | #32

If this isn't the initial tweet, it should certainly be considered for a subsequent post.

-------------------------

zyler9985 | 2023-07-29 04:04:59 UTC | #33

this is fucking epic

Yeah, longform is a must to mark the biggest airdrop in crypto history. Our principled man of mystery relinquishing the few powers he had left, like a mother bird chucking her baby off a cliff to see if it flies or not.

We were gonna wait until next weekend before posting anything, to allow time for other people to submit their testimonies. The idea is that the first tweet is a thread made entirely of  community member quotes

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-07-29 17:31:01 UTC | #39

Who made that decision?

-------------------------

Stark | 2023-07-29 20:59:42 UTC | #40

The main account should serve as a pulpit, and it should only retweet. This way, you know who's words are being broadcasted. 

The notion of the community adopting the voice and identity of Zenon Main as a central idol would be a step in the wrong direction, as it is opposed to decentralized ethos.

There is no need to say "goodbye" or make an echo chamber announcement **to ourselves** about the Twitter decentralization.

Zenon Twitter has 13.5k followers who *have all seen and heard it before*. Retweets from actual community members are more meaningful.

Expanding into the universe, grinding, and building, as we are all actively doing, will develop and enable access to much bigger, more reputable, and meaningful platforms than Zenon Main Twitter. The sooner this account falls into the lore, the better, because that will signify that the community has risen up.

The weight of this account should be leveraged for all its worth to promote decentralization. People need to see their own brand and words getting retweeted and engaged with, in order to stoke the motivational flywheel. 

If you write a post for Zenon Main, and it gets approved, it does little to nothing for your own Twitter account, reputation, brand, pillar, etc. If anything, I might even argue that your words will carry much *less* meaning to the intended audience if tweeted natively from Zenon Main.

Let's support the developers, teams, and dreamers that comprise the NoM in the most authentic way. You are brilliant and your words matter. You are important. Speak and Tweet your words. **You are meant to be seen.**

I love what you wrote, @coinselor - if you tweet that, I would fully support a retweet on any and all accounts.

I think this is an interesting proposal. Will community members go through the effort of submitting a PR requesting a RT?

Also, it's possible the community cannot or does not tweet about new cutting edge tech.  If zenon_network does not create original tweets, how does it show off new tech the community does not talk about or explains incorrectly?

What if the existing zenon_network intern wants to tweet?  We don't have access to the twitter account or secrets.  We should not assume the intern got fired.  

Speaking of interns...  We need some meme / autistic video like this about NoM.

coinselor | 2023-07-30 03:15:54 UTC | #46

I'm not entirely against the idea of retweet only, but it feels extremely limited for not much gain, even philosophically. Keep in mind, there will always be a record of the original tweet creator from the PR that eventually gets merged. We should always encourage people to create their own PRs. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure in the published open-sourced code of the Twitter algorithm, a retweet gets significantly less exposure, so from a game theoretical point of view, we'll be at a reach disadvantage. 

The messages I might craft intended to be scrutinized by the Zenon community will be somewhat or entirely different from the message I will post on my personal Twitter feed. I understand the audience is not entirely the same and will adjust my tone/voice/message accordingly.

Agree with Stark. You are not making any sense. We are all one and the same. Question is, if the intern posts without submitting a PR, can we edit/delete it using the Twitter, together API?

zyler9985 | 2023-07-30 06:41:41 UTC | #49

So retweets only, I understand that logic, and it's very well said.

But to signify the passing of the torch, using the actual account to create a thread made entirely of community quotes is powerful. that could even be the last tweet from the official account before it becomes a retweeting machine.

Also, retweets only is still debateable. My position is just about the first tweet.

-------------------------

He's referring to this: https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/verified-organizations

See the pricing table, verified organizations can have affiliates.

ZenonOrg could pay for the Verified Organization and give an affiliate seat for Zenon_Network, however it would have to come out of AZ for both. $1,000 / month!

That's if Mr. Kaine & co don't want to pay for Twitter Blue for Zenon_Network.

-------------------------

Stark | 2023-07-30 17:19:17 UTC | #55

I see both sides of it, as well. I'm glad I voiced some facets of the discussion but I'm open minded and respect all the opinions perspectives expressed, here.

I really like @coinselor tweet style and I think it matches well in terms of brand continuity for tone and flavor. Maybe we could do something like elect a Tweetor in Chief?

Or.... perhaps a variety of flavor and content will authentically express the fact that Zenon is a community project, comprised of individuals with a wide variety of mental problems, who are all in it for the technology.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-07-30 17:52:01 UTC | #57

There should be a coherent content & branding strategy based on clearly defined personas. Ideally managed by someone with a successful track record in content marketing

I was hoping we could fine-tune ChatGPT to learn from all previous Zenon_network's tweets to slightly modify the tone/voice of all messages moving forward for maximum coherence with our previous self. Branding-wise, I'm sure most of us would agree Zenon has done an outstanding job already and it's on us to keep it up.

Content strategy should definitely be developed as you suggest, by someone knowledgeable, so we can have some direction for content ideas.

-------------------------

mehowbrainz | 2023-07-30 21:06:56 UTC | #60

I'm not getting too distracted with these new Twitter powers yet. The wZNN-ETH pool keeps getting deeper but swap volume into wZNN + price has some way to go. Energy should be focused on developing marketing strategies to grow new participation. And that can be done from any handle. An outbound @Zenon_Network tweeting content strategy is a portion of the overall requirements to get new wZNN buyers + network participation.

-------------------------

zyler9985 | 2023-07-31 03:18:42 UTC | #61

I was honestly just thinking use the account to make that thread as both a goodbye and a statement on the huge passing of the torch, demonstrating it by using the account directly

then pretty much doing retweets only, except for things like a new contract address/ a necessary wallet upgrade ... because that way the onus isn't on the individual being retweeted but on the group responsible for the official tweets for essential infos like that

Also, retweets only is still debateable.

I'm not sold on RT only.  What if Sol has something unique and novel to report and wants to say it on zenon_network first.  Sort of like breaking news of alien tech.  

Plus, tweeting and then RT in GH is more effort.  Who will be the person that goes around looking for tweets to RT.  The actual tweeter will be unlikely to go into GH and make a PR.  It's just not a usual workflow.  This approach will lead to less community tweeting on zenon_network.  I'm pretty sure the people who approve PRs in the /twitter repo will not be looking for stuff to RT.

Also, think of the average user. Imagine the official page just retweets the contract address and so on. Can cause confusion and uncertainty. It instills more confidence if it's the official page tweeting the contract address. Retweets only is the ideological ideal, but i'm not sold on its practicality, especially in early days where there's teething issues to be sorted out.

An outbound @Zenon_Network tweeting content strategy is a portion of the overall requirements to get new wZNN buyers + network participation.

Tweeting on @Zenon_Network gives us a way to communicate in a unified manner.

ZenonOrg could pay for the Verified Organization and give an affiliate seat for Zenon_Network, however it would have to come out of AZ for both. $1,000 / month!

What if we paid an existing organization $50/mo?

Probably the best idea if we can find a willing organization. Ideally one which aligns with Zenon's ethos. [Bitcoin Magazine](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine)?

Gonna propose something soon to help with this.

Clever workaround, big-brained aliens. We should definitely be able to find a willing organization.

I haven't received any submissions, the thread of alien quotes isn't happening.

Everyone loved coinselor's take though, I'd be for tweeting that.

Aliens never give up.

I'm finally back home, I'll be adding my contributions to the https://twitter.com/SultanOfStaking/status/1687255069140353025?s=20

I suggest every single Alien does the same.

We are an independent entity, but we depend on collective effort. 

I'll also create a few tweet PRs.
