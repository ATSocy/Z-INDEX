Looks like there are a few issues to report on SYRIUS v0.0.6.  Should we report here on the forum or in @aliencoder's repo for SYRIUS?

Better to report here on the forum. I think we want to prevent another big PR; better to isolate each bug fix in a seperate branch on the repo whoever fixes the bug.
