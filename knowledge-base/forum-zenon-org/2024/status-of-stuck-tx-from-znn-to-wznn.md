All stuck ZNN to wZNN swaps have been sent to Mr Kaine. He said that they’ll unstuck them after the bridge is deprecated.  If you want to document your stuck TX again, feel free to reply to this thread with the transaction details.  You can do it anonymously too.  However, I'm not sure it will improve the situation in any way.  If you previously reported the TX to Sigli, Mr. Kaine has them.

I wish there was something more I could do to help.

I have ZNN stuck here. Was trying ZNN -> wZNN on BSC Bridge. It was on Jan 20, 2023. Been almost half a year now.

Tx: https://explorer.zenon.org/transaction/fdbb3df5f362f91f7f73da4f126549e371f5f78f03f956b4cea0fbfaf6349511

I have DM'ed this info to Sigli (who deleted his TG account now, and was of no help at all) and deeznnutz (who gave helpful replies).

Documenting here too. I'll keep checking this thread every month from now.

My friend has a  wznn to znn transaction that's stuck .
Bsc transaction hash - 0xc865d5931dcfa6fff07902d57c5d7f75c78bcb349c71a63852274908d3866018

It's a very small amount. It's been a while now
