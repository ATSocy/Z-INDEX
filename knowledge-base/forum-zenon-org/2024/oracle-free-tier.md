Looks like Oracle got their free tier on ARM credit card processing issue resolved.  I was able to sign up for a free account.  Or at least get past the credit card authentication issue.  We should all be able to run a free node on the Oracle infra.  Once they approve me I will setup a node on ARM and help others do the same.  If you want to do this (for free w/ DOXing) sign up below and let's deploy more nodes for free.

@sol did we ever resolve how to build go-zenon for ARM?  I think we did but cannot remember 100%.  I would love to adapt my znndNode setup so people can deploy here.
