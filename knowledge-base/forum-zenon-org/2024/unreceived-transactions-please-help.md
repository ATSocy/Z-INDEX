Thread: unreceived-transactions-please-help

Hello folks, 

I just logged into my wallet for the first time in a while and collected my pillar rewards from Zircon.  The transaction was made but I have never received the ZNN.  
I checked my address at zenonhub, and see is is 'unreceived', as well as 1000 PP unreceived a month ago.  

Please help me out here, not sure what the issue is.

Are you using 0.0.7 syrius?

Unlike other L1s, you need to actually receive the TX.  you do that by opening your wallet.

update: reboot and restart of wallet and both tx's received.
it was strange bc the wallet had been open and synced yesterday. Restart of the wallet didn't change anything; only reboot.  Weird shit
