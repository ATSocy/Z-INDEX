This template will appear as the basis for your A-Z proposal once you create a new topic in this category. Discourse has some nice editing tools to make it look nice and you can copy/paste images/graphs from other documents as needed. Also use the forum post URL once submitted (just edit your post to add it) for the proposal URL field.

---

**Project Name:** Your Proposal Name Here

**Description:** A one paragraph explanation of the core of what you plan to deliver. Make in concise and to the point, explain what benefit it brings to the network and community and how you plan to deliver it. **Explain why your project is vital to the success of Zenon, both in the short and long term?** In other words, what problem is it solving?

**URL:** Enter your URL for the proposal if you have one, if not then edit the post after you submit it and use the Forum URL for your post. https://forum2.zenon.org/your-post-here

**Team:** Background, skills and resources you / your team bring to the project. Even if the project idea is a good one, why are you the one(s) who should be funded to do it when those funds could go to others (even if to do the same thing)?

> **Phases**

**What is your high-level roadmap?** It is encouraged to submit projects with phases where possible with each phase delivering some unit of value to the community. How many phases are you submitting for, what deliverables will be in each phase, what is the estimated timing of each phase, and most importantly what value will be delivered to the community in each phase? Include as many phases as you need for delivery. Payment is linked to Phase completion.

**Phase 1**
High level overview of main tasks:
- Task 1
- Task 2
- Task 3

Completion of Phase 1 will be measured by:

* Achieving task X and Y
* Delivering objective Q and R

**Phase 2**
High level overview of main tasks:
- Task 1
- Task 2
- Task 3

Completion of Phase 2 will be measured by:

* Achieving task X and Y
* Delivering objective Q and R

**Phase 3**
High level overview of main tasks:
- Task 1
- Task 2
- Task 3

Completion of Phase 3 will be measured by:

* Achieving task X and Y
* Delivering objective Q and R

> **Funding**

**Total Requested Funding** = XX ZNN and XX QSR
**Project Duration** = XX months

 **How did you calculate your budget?** Did you estimate development hours against a certain rate, and then multiply that by the current price of ZNN & QSR? If yes, how many hours did you project? What was the rate you used? What was the market price of ZNN & QSR at time of budget formulation? Did you estimate your budget based on comparable projects? If yes, can you explain the logic behind their pricing model and can you explain that logic to the Pillar operators? Do you need to buy tools to do the job? Are you baking in a premium for risk or opportunity cost? The important thing here is not so much the budget amount, but how you derived that amount. Budgets should be well thought out and aligned to project phases.

**Project and Payment Milestones:**
**Phase 1**
Funding Request: 50% (XX ZNN and XX QSR)
Duration: XX months

**Phase 2**
Funding Request: 25% (XX ZNN and XX QSR)
Duration: XX months

**Phase 3**
Funding Request: 25% (XX ZNN and XX QSR)
Duration: XX months


> **Other Information**

**Risks, Assumptions, Known Issues, Dependencies:** What are the variables and dependencies? Do you have contingency plans for significant assumptions, variables, and dependencies?

**Have you previously submitted a proposal (either in Acclerator-Z or Incubator)?** If yes, how did they turn out? Link to all previous proposals or finished products

Any additional information of graphs/images/data can go here at the end.

@sultanofstaking I've rolled in your words and headings into the template above - I feel if someone were to follow this template now they should have all the info a Pillar owner would want to assess the proposal in depth and fairly

@romeo this is great! We can definitely continue to refine over time but this is pretty comprehensive - thanks for doing that

I think it is time we revisited this topic and evolved how we think about / approve AZ. I propose we (everyone not just pillars) re-look at a template, ratify it, and make it part of the process. My only suggested edits are to add a "definition of success" in the very first section & subsequent phases i.e., what does success look like for the initiative as a whole and for each phase. This should be measurable not just delivery of something (if nobody uses it or it doesn't improve performance or lay a platform to do so, why do it). I would also add a demo requirement to each payout phase. Demo includes review of your original biz case, where we are today, explanation for deltas, and actual demo of whatever it is that you built. 

I dont think this is too much to ask. I also think if we are to grow into "global adoption" our current process will be taken advantage of.

To build the muscle memory around this for my pillar I will be expecting to see the following for any AZ activity:
1. Usage of this template w/ the suggested edits for idea approval
2. Demo as outlined above for funds approval

I can modify the template to suit - also very keen to see it being used again as I think it would remove a large proportion of the confusion around AZ asks
