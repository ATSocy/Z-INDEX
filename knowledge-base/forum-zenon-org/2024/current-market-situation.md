Sup guys,

the Off Topic section seems to be a bit abandoned besides the archived Zenon tweets so I decided to post a thread in hopes to gather some informations for me aswell for other Aliens that want to understand the current market situation better and want to be able to derive useful knowledge to position themselves better in the next bull run.
Is anyone experienced in here that has some useful and high quality sources (books, articles etc.) that help to understand this huge topic from a macro-economic perspective and want to share them?

Yes!  I'll post a list of stuff I track later today.  I track an insane amount of macro and have about 10 - 15 podcasts I track.  They are awesome and I watch them all the time.

I find kitko news is a great source of info, they're on youtube

heaps of different guests from pro traders to former hedgefund managers etc. so you get a variety of opinions, and a lot of the stuff they mention is important even if you don't understand it â€“ it means that when you try to study from a textbook, certain parts of the textbook you will pay extra attention because of things you have heard them say a lot

thank you very much, there are some very interesting podcasts on this list.

Also, a book about the complete market history that i recently put on my list and sounds very interesting:
Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation by Edward Chancellor

A book I've been reading as of late that's pretty great is called *'Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail'* by Ray Daloi- who is a billionaire investor and hedge fund manager. The principles and his reasoning is very sound imo.

A summary of his book can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xguam0TKMw8
