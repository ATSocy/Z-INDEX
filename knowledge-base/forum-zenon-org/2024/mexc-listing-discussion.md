Mexc approached us about listing on their exchange.  They presented a number of options.

Rough order of magnitude is 60k to list.  They have a few options of USDT or USDT and tokens.  They asked us not to share the proposal outright.  If you DM me I can share it privately and ask that you do not post on the forum.  

I know everyone has had different feedback on Mexc listings.  I think an Mexc listing is inevitable, but question if now is the time. Look at the $kas volume on Mexc.  It appears to be the largest volume or all exchanges.  They did just list with Binance, so I assume they will take over.  

I also want to throw out the idea of funding these listings with community contributions rather than AZ.  $kas funded all their listings with a pass the hat.  I think we can do the same.  I'm prepared to contribute and I know others will do so too.  I've privately DM'd many community members and they are willing to donate. 

So if we want to list on Mexc let's expect we need to raise 60K from the community in contributions.  We can send $usdt to @shaimo for capital raises.  I've done very large OTC trades with him and he has been here since time 0. 

What does everyone think?

The more exchanges the better. It would be good for the project. Having read the posts from below, seems like we could make the listing fee go down.

Reports re: MEXC indicate questionable service quality validates various reports from zenon community members. Not worth pursuing imo, esp. since regular wallet / custody updates will be necessary and will lead to a very bad UX if the exchange doesnt stay on top of it.

I was against paying exchanges for listing, but looking at how many microcaps performed recently with only being listed on SafeTrade or MEXC, and considering that many newcomers were asking how to buy the coin outside of Uniswap, it makes me think we need to have at least one exchange before the next bull run kicks off.. also not everyone is willing to pay high fees to trade on ETH, plus additional high fees to bridge. I like the idea of raising the listing fees rather than using AZ.. KAS community was able to do so for CEX listings, marketing, and developer funding.

Also, the only FUD I heard regarding MEXC was about how they are suppressing prices and dumping tokens, but again, we can pay with only USDT. However, imo the only tokens complaining about MEXC's actions are those that didn't experience a pump, so they blame it on MEXC's fault. KAS pumped 100x on MEXC since listing, so where is their price suppression here?

-------------------------

zyler9985 | 2023-11-25 11:05:09 UTC | #6

I looked into MEXC after hearing some bad stuff about it. I don't think AZ should be used, definitely not.

I wouldn't encourage people to raise money for this either without disclosing all the risks involved and the ways that it can be a waste of money and counter-productive. And looking at KAS is not ideal because that project is an outlier – what about most of the stuff listed on MEXC? How does it go for them?

I'm all for a listing on a small exchange, but only if it has a good reputation and only if it seems like the right time.

That is what we exactly need, make it easier for newcomers. 100% agree

nbd | 2023-11-25 13:30:09 UTC | #8

Exactly. But if the community wants absolutely to list on mexc we can list wznn erc20 instead of native. This way we won’t have issues with them with wallet updates, fork, spork….but $60k for an erc20 token listing is too much. Mexc is not a good choice so I won’t contribute personally.

-------------------------

Zashounet | 2023-11-25 14:01:52 UTC | #9

People often associate CEX listings with two main benefits: increased visibility and a healthier market with easier onboarding. However, these advantages may not materialize with a listing on MEXC. This platform lists about three projects per day, and most of these projects show minimal trading volume with their price charts looking like your casual shitcoin rug. 

Also, our ethos conflicts with the idea of having users purchase znn on a  cex and leaving their funds there. If potential buyers are not familiar with purchasing on platforms like Uniswap, it is unlikely they will be able to install and use Syrius.

If mexc is willing to list us for free, they can proceed but paying for it is a waste of funds in my opinion.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-11-25 14:15:46 UTC | #10

The more exchange the more diluted our liquidity is. Your reasoning is probably a made belief construction. Exchanges are good when they offer market making strategies or are top tier. Mexc doesn't fit any of that.

Newcomers know well how to use Uniswap. QUBIC succeeded on Safetrade because of CFB and hard shill from the mining community, not because of that exchange.

This raise another point: what do you think the money will be used for? They will accumulate and dump on your face down to 0. If you give them tokens, it'll be even easier for them. They're not your friend, they don't care about us, Zenon, or whatever.

-------------------------

shaimo | 2023-11-25 14:41:20 UTC | #13

I personally don’t like mexc. I think it’s one of the only exchanges I don’t even have an account on. I also heard the bad stories on how they dump newly listed tokens.
The main benefit of listing there is getting exposure to a shitload of new potential buyers, which we extremely need, given how under the radar we are right now. Whether it justifies paying $60k I don’t know.

-------------------------

Asgardians-Pillar | 2023-11-25 14:57:48 UTC | #14

Haggle it down to 10k so that it's not to expensive and a possible insta dump from MEXC wouldn't be that nasty.

-------------------------

nbd | 2023-11-25 15:04:55 UTC | #15

Free listing or gtfo. We don’t need them. They need us.

-------------------------

kw1da1 | 2023-11-25 15:50:48 UTC | #16

I think it may be wise to do as Asgardian says, haggle them down to 10k-20k but for listing of wZNN that way there’s no concerns with them dumping a substantial amount of tokens and if they don’t hold up their end of the deal and don’t have to be relied on for heavy maintenance duties of native ZNN.  Just my 2 cents

-------------------------

Samwinter1888 | 2023-11-25 16:00:57 UTC | #17

Coins usually react well to listings and buyers get more options where to buy from. But I agree with you, this low tier exchange may not do that. 

60k seems too much to pay for it, if we could get the price down to 10-20k it may be a good idea.

-------------------------

NeoShredder | 2023-11-25 16:58:29 UTC | #18

We have built so much already . What we are going to build in the future are much more than what we have already built.

There is no reason for us to get desperate . Exchanges will come to us. We just need to wait.

We had a tainted past trying to reach masses

1.Stuck coins in BSC chain
2. Stuck coins in mercatox
3. Stex fiasco(maybe this ended well better than others)

We don't need another failure. We just need to wait. It will be soon. They can't ignore us for long.

Not sure if true but if MEXC indeed leaks position data to affiliates it's a ticking time bomb.

Seen a couple of communities complain about MEXC suppressing price and market making for themselves. Haven't used them personally.

They are non KYC but ban US visitors.

$60k is daylight robbery, wouldn't consider it for fundraising or AZ for anything over $20k, preferably closer to $10k

-------------------------

angelo_a_jr | 2023-11-26 06:05:00 UTC | #21

I was for MEXC listing prior to seeing some of the sketchier anecdotes that were brought up in this thread.

I know there's a lot of excitement around PA right now and a CEX could certainly add to this.

However, we've come this far now even with the onboarding challenges and built-in principles of NoM, namely decentralization

I think in the long-term we have more to gain from keeping in line with this ethos and instead focusing on opening up to more DEXes:

THORSwap
Opening up EVM bridges for Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, BNB, etc. 
Trading pairs with USDT & USDC

Not all at once but strategically timed.  The smart money in crypto will find a way to the gems even if there's some friction.  This then provides leverage over CEXes for listings as retail will demand it from their exchange.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-11-26 10:59:47 UTC | #22

It's hilarious and sad to see people throwing random price for a listing thinking MEXC would do great for Zenon. Based on what? I've read that 10k would be great, compared to what? For what results? Did they even look at the userbase? The volume? The MM? Previous deals and their performance post listing haven't even been looked at. Those people never negociated a deal with a CEX, have no ideas how things work and can't process the fact that this isn't the Cryptopia era. Yet they talk and give their opinion like if it matters. You all want a MEXC or low tier listing like a Christian pray. C'mon.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-12-01 19:04:24 UTC | #23

Imo preference is low for low tier listings. Dex until tier 1 cex that lists znn largely on its own.

-------------------------

NeoShredder | 2023-11-26 12:47:18 UTC | #24

[/quote]

I have spoken to 7 CEXs over the past 12 months (since STEX went down) and got quotes from most for native ZNN integration. $10k is what I would call a deal worth considering

-------------------------

Samwinter1888 | 2023-11-27 09:59:52 UTC | #26

Maybe we should ask Mercatox to list us back? 
I know they screwed up with token swap, but they could at least list wZNN.

Before the volume on their exchange was ok.

-------------------------

yakenem | 2023-11-27 10:30:01 UTC | #27

60k kinda overkill for Mexc. I've been in talks for listing with Mexc and they usually list for 20k erc20 tokens. They have their own MM bots on the orderbook and they arbitrage between Uniswap and them exchanges. So, unless we receive high volume it might not be the best place to go.
However, I don't see exchanges listing us for free unless we create 2-3m volume every day, so waiting is not a solution as well.
We can aim for xeggex or safe.trade as many people are searching those places for hidden gems and it might be stepping stone. They shouldn't require 10s of k as well and maybe come for free even. Then as volume comes, the other exchanges would consider listing for free.
just my 2 cents.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-11-27 13:23:55 UTC | #28

And I'm telling you this doesn't represent the industry standards as price only doesn't matter. Read my message again, I know you can.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-11-27 13:23:02 UTC | #29

And what exactly a cex would solve? New users are at ease with Uniswap.

-------------------------

yakenem | 2023-11-27 14:36:16 UTC | #30

well, I know tons of people that don't use Uniswap and they are always using only cex. Believe it or not, cexes necessary at some point. Believing this will have a wide use without exposure is unrealistic. 
Waiting for exchanges to get in line to list us is also not realistic unless we create millions of volumes for a long period of time. There are projects that didn't pay a dime probably but that's because they had 10s of millions volume. So it all comes down to exposure. 
If we can create those volumes sustainably then we can relax and wait and more exposure would come, else it won't happen.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-11-27 19:25:57 UTC | #32

Surely a shit cex will onboard them all and their 20$ portfolio. 

We don't need this kind of CEXs. Scroll Coingecko and see by yourself rather than enforcing your make beliefs analysis.

-------------------------

Samwinter1888 | 2023-11-29 09:48:12 UTC | #33

Gate.io seems like an ok exchange, does anyone know how much it is to list there?

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-11-29 23:53:48 UTC | #34

Not interested.

-------------------------

Jeruweb3 | 2023-11-30 01:35:09 UTC | #35

Since They approached first and if it is free, why not?

-------------------------

NeoShredder | 2023-11-30 10:50:17 UTC | #36

They don't need our permission for free listing. Do they?

-------------------------

Phuong | 2023-12-01 10:01:29 UTC | #37

Allow me to play devil's advocate. Sure, MEXC is not ideal as there have been serious complaints about them in the past, but having native ZNN on a cex attracts more attention. We had a price pump which has cooled down, so interest wanes - people move on to whatever seems to have the hot narrative. 

Only waiting for a tier 1 exchange to list ZNN for free may or may not happen, but being able to show volume on a known exchange makes it more likely imo. Keeping attention is hard and the marketing initiative on Twitter can only do so much. Also having a cex listing would bring more people into the znn universe. I say strike while the iron is hot rather than waiting for the red carpet to be rolled out to us. Flame away.

-------------------------

oginotvavra | 2023-12-01 11:34:14 UTC | #38

We should get out of our bubble that the exchanges will grovel and beg to take us on. Better to be realists than extreme optimists

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-12-01 13:36:47 UTC | #39

There's ongoing discussions for a better exchange than Mexc and it should be free for us.

I can't disclose ongoing discussion under NDA so no. But I let you know what I can. I'm not the one leading this but it looks promising and if it's free the community has no say here. However this information can be useful to keep in the back of our mind.

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-12-03 00:52:28 UTC | #49

Assumption. Fact is that wznn creates attribution incentives for bridging. Znn doesnt.

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-12-03 01:04:09 UTC | #50

The friction goes both ways. Buying ZNN immediately might allow people to step right away into the ecosystem.

-------------------------

oginotvavra | 2023-12-03 09:15:33 UTC | #51

Im also nativ token holder and Im not going to buy the wrapped one. Not because Im lazy but Im not that tech-savvy for fear of doing something wrong. There will be many like me

-------------------------

cryptocheshire | 2023-12-03 16:06:30 UTC | #52

And that's why you're less likely to sell

-------------------------

dat_she_pepe | 2023-12-03 16:27:23 UTC | #53

And not likely to buy on cex which is another kind of friction.

There are a couple of CEXs in Turkey, and I think we can reach some of them. The most popular three CEXs are [BTC Turk](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/btcturk-pro/), [CoinTR](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/cointr/) and [Paribu](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/paribu/). You can click on the names and see CoinMarketCap exchange information.

We should get listed asap and getting listed somewhere will hopefully raise the price.
