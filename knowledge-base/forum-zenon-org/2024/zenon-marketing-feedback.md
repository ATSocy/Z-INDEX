Guys,

Wanted to draw your attention to a survey that was posted on TG some time ago.  Not sure if everyone saw it.  Iâ€™m reporting here hoping that all the Alienz complete the survey and give some feedback.   @ johnzinc on TG posted it.  He can also be found on Twitter here:  https://twitter.com/johnthzone

> guyz, I've seen many ways of positioning Zenon (both from the core team & from you the community). I think it might be helpful to do a positioning exercise regarding the Zenon brand and value proposition, so I am conducting a form where I wanna take your marketing pulse. It would only take you only some minutes and I'm sure we'll gain great insights. https://s.surveyplanet.com/prrprmz5
