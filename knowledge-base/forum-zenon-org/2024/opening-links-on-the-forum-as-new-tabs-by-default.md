Thread: opening-links-on-the-forum-as-new-tabs-by-default

There's about 34 users in the forums (@0x3639 checked the database), which don't have the setting applied to open new links as a new tab. You can of it in your preferences:

1) Interface tab on the left pane
2) Under "Other" check "Open all external links in a new tab"

Hope this helps!
