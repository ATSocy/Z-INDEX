Hello,

the fact that the explorer shows it in unreceived transactions means that your zennies have safely been transferred on-chain :). If you just created a syrius account and are running the embedded node (orange circle in the right hand corner of the wallet) then your node needs to sync to the latest momentum (will turn green when complete). Might take a while but it'll get there.

Alternatively, you could try connecting to one of these public nodes in the node management section of the accounts tab to instantly synchronize with the ledger and to start putting your zennies to work- 

ws://node01.0x3639.com:35998
ws://node02.0x3639.com:35998
ws://node03.0x3639.com:35998
