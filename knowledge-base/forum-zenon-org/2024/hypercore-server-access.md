I would like to make an effort to admit more server administrators to the forum.  A server administrators will be able to see passwords to central services, such as mailgun and stackpath.  They will also be able to restore and move the server in the event @Romeo and/or I become incapacitated.  Today Romeo and I are the only community members with admin access.

How does everyone feel about granting all HyperCore members server access to the forum?

[poll type=regular results=always chartType=bar]
* YES grant HyperCore members server access
* NO don't grant HyperCore members server access
[/poll]
