I'll redesign the bridge entirely using the BagSwap components / styling. It's one thing to improve its interface / styling (UI), it's another to improve its experience (UX). 

Make your list of bridge UX / UI improvement requests / ideas, while being as detailed as possible. Also if you like certain bridge flows, feel free to showcase them as examples.

Thanks,

We critically need to fix this issue I reported. Many new users are getting frustrated by this.

Here are the manual instructions to correct it.

Why?  Did Dexter address it?

Thank you for picking this up, sir. Some of the things I'd like to see improved:

- There are a lot of checks the user has to go through before entering the dApp. I don't see this on other bridge dApps. Maybe just a security warning for users asking if they're from outside the US?

- When unwrapping multiple transactions, it redirects you to another page instead of staying on the "unwrap transaction" page. This leads to having to press on "Existing Swaps" again in order to unwrap the next transaction.

- There are too many steps: Connect "WalletConnect" + Connect "Ethereum wallet." Maybe implement an automated popup prompting users to select their Web3 wallet? Or maybe a "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner (which a lot of webdapps use).

- Add a "How-to-bridge" page along with other useful resources

Example: https://debridge.finance/
