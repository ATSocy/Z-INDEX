Does anyone here know much about [Urbit](https://urbit.org/) and considered how, if at all, it can work in conjunction with Zenon?

It seems very philosophically aligned with Zenon (fully P2P, 100% owned by users, etc.) and some of the most forward thinking technologists seem to be pretty into it.  Even a lot of the terminology is similar (galaxies, stars, etc.)

Opening this thread to see if anyone has explored the intersection of the two.
