Hello! 

I'm a graphic designer and I made this account to start contributing for Zenon.

I redesigned the Syrius wallet icon to make it look more professional.


**Dark mode:**

 Hope you like it. Looking forward for more contributions.

@jovi can you make a [MacOS icon following Apple's guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons)?

```
{
  "images" : [

If the logo is accepted I suggest a 250 to 300 ZNN A.Z fund ask. The professional price for a logo is 500$ approximately. I would support that

-------------------------

ZNNAYIID | 2023-06-27 11:04:03 UTC | #11

Great work! I can’t wait to see it on Blaze mobile app, and maybe the new redesigned extension.

-------------------------

sumamu | 2023-06-27 15:58:29 UTC | #12

Awesome! Can you also make some for the Wrapped ZNN and Wrapped QSR tokens on Ethereum? I'm updating them tomorrow and was thinking what to use.

-------------------------

ZNNAYIID | 2023-06-27 16:53:17 UTC | #13

For wrapped ZNN and QSR on eth, I think changing the colors to some grayish gradient will do the trick. 

But we’ll definitely need some kind of unique symbol for wrapped assets on NoM.

Can someone help me removing the restriction to add a single image per post? @sumamu @mehowbrainz

-------------------------

jovi | 2023-06-27 17:36:39 UTC | #16

I finished them, waiting to lift the 1 image/post restriction.

-------------------------

ZNNAYIID | 2023-06-27 18:16:26 UTC | #17

Can you try now?

[/quote]

I will dm you a link with the zip file because I'm unable to properly upload everything over here.

-------------------------

jovi | 2023-06-27 20:16:32 UTC | #20

I cannot upload .ico file over here (required for the Windows app icon)

-------------------------

ZNNAYIID | 2023-06-27 20:37:04 UTC | #21

@aliencoder I suggest to not use this icon with syrius desktop until some major updates including a new ui/ux.. I don’t see any reason to use such a beautiful icon with the same 2 y.o wallet.

Edit. Maybe it’s just me, but I see this icon fitting more on a mobile/extension app than a desktop software.

-------------------------

ZNNAYIID | 2023-06-27 20:34:27 UTC | #22

Maybe try to upload it to WeTransfer or any other uploading services and paste the link here.

I've followed the Apple guidelines for the MacOS app icon (bottom shadow). I can prepare them for mobile, too.

The problem is that transfer links usually expire. But I can dm the link with the resources.

0x3639 | 2023-06-27 21:59:15 UTC | #24

what is the issue exactly?  Upload size or attachment type?

I just added the .ico extension to the authorized list.

Is this logo update still in progress?

I support this.

This one also looks cool! But our current design also features the green/blue, so it'd be only natural to keep that imo :)

-------------------------

CryptoFish | 2024-02-21 09:38:38 UTC | #33

What's the status on this? We could change the syrius icon for v0.2.0.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-05-19 16:23:36 UTC | #34

@CryptoFish this icon is pretty cool.  Did we update the syrius desktop icon to match this?

-------------------------

CryptoFish | 2024-05-19 16:56:09 UTC | #35

No we did not change the icon.

@jovi we are working on the support forum for syrius wallet: https://support.syriuswallet.com

We need two logos.  You can see the requirements and dimensions from discourse below.  

1) logo: star logo with the words "s y r i u s wallet' after it.  Transparent background.  
2) logo small: star logo with a transparent background

The size of the star in the two logos needs to be the same.  

![Screenshot 2024-06-13 at 9.11.35 AM|666x500](upload://uVce3MetGatNMiRdRGl7VMCToAp.png)


The star should be a little larger with a transparent background.  You can see below the current star size is a little too small.    
![Screenshot 2024-06-13 at 9.16.01 AM|690x97](upload://jQTFGMm4mgpKmompYZafNo2RdMU.png)

Note the example below the size of the {H} is the same for both logos.

@jovi we're trying to replace the syrius desktop icon, but in order to replace it we need a proper icon file containing the 16,32,48,64,128 and 256 versions.

I've attached an archive to this post which contains all the syrius icon assets for both macOS, Linux and Windows that need to be replaced in order to change the desktop icon.

It would be awasome If you could create a replacement for each asset file in the archive.

[syrius-icons-0.2.1.apk|attachment](upload://aHUVfsjrdlid6oUKXrBuodvJLwP.apk) (263.1 KB)

P.S. rename the archive extention to .zip once downloaded.

I've noticed that all the icons have a transparant border. This results in the icon to look smaller. 

Can you remove the transparent border and use all the available icon space.

Below some comparisons.

This is better. Seems like the Linux and MacOS icons have the transparant border and only the ico version does not.

I've added the changes and created a [PR](https://github.com/zenon-network/syrius/pull/126).
