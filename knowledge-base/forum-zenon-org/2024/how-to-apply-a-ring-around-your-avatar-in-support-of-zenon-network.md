For those who haven't applied a ring around their avatar, you can use this tool which overlays one image over another.

[https://pinetools.com/overlay-images](https://pinetools.com/overlay-images)

The main image would be your pfp @ 720x720px in size

The ring image comes from the brand assets page: [https://zenonorg.notion.site/](https://zenonorg.notion.site/)  You can also download the image below.
