**Project Name:** ZNN PHP

**Description:**  A PHP SDK which can be used to interact with the read-only JSON-RPC endpoints of Zenon.

The code and documentation are available via the link below or install it with composer:
 `composer require digitalsloth/znn-php` 

At the moment I am not planning on adding support for transactions or smart contracts but I will be using this as a starting point for a bigger project.

**URL:** https://github.com/digitalSloth/znn-php 

**Funding:** 500ZNN | 100QSR
