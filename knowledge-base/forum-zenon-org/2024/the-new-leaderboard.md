I just enabled the "gamification" plugin.  I need to setup better navigation so we can link to this on the home page, but in the meantime, here is the link:  https://forum2.zenon.org/leaderboard

Cool to see all our active community members on this list.

Is there a plugin for a "New Members" page like this? I'm always curious if people are signing up here.
