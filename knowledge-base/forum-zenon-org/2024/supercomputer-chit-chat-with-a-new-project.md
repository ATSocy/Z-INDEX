I've just discussed briefly with a person from another project and he told me they were working on a supercomoputer thing. The usual, you think, but he then he talked about universities and ongoing partnerships. I copy the lines here:

Scrolling their Discord (https://discord.gg/CWjPPxTnne) I saw mentions of contacts at Nvidia and no will to make a P&D token. I didn't have a long time to investigate further but I offered him / her to invite you in so you can talk if you wish to do so. I'll share the link to this discussion with him too.

I mentioned Zenon in our discussion as the feeless properties of the NoM could be interesting in this case. I think they have a token but we have a bridge, let's talk and see if we can work something together.
