Funding proposal for the Supernova genesis video:

When I realized we didn't have anything prepared for the Supernova launch, I put the production of this video on super rush priority to ensure its completion, in time for the Supernova genesis.

Video production and distribution are two separate areas. I am requesting funding for the `value of production of a 30 second promo video.`

I believe this work falls under the scope of AZ but I would like to know what the community thinks.

I'm not asking for funding for the distribution but I'm sure people will want to know.

There are additional stats not shown herein because:
1. The video was initially retweeted by @Zenon_Network and then that tweet was removed in favor of a native upload and more description.
2. I grinded 130+ strategic and personalized replies on X with the video link. Those stats are not aggregated in the stats below. The reply grind totals an additional 2600+ impressions and 300+ likes as of right now.

Stark puts an outstanding input into the marketing side of the project - and all his work is brilliant.
Thank you Zir!
Please reward these initiatives as losing these kind of people would result in Zenon R.I.P - if not from AZ funds, I'm willing to support him with 50 ZNN from my own budget. Anyone else? Cheers

The video is very cool BTW.

Strongly support any long time community members/contributors for their sacrifice and time i dont care about the impressions or views, that will come later when the work has more active sharing and support. 

It would be a good use of AZ funds but if that is somehow out of reach then happy to donate.

I can contribute 50 ZNN for the work, and 50 ZNN for the rights to use/modify it for future zenon.org lead marketing campaigns i.e. press releases, articles, newsletters, funnels. Please reply if you agree @Stark
