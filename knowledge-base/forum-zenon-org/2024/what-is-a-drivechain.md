What is a drivechain?

Something bitcoin maxis seem to dislike as they opposed a BIP that would enable it on Bitcoin

That's important info related to  [marketing and naming conventions.](https://forum2.zenon.org/t/extension-chain-l2/1645/3?u=stark) - this also matters in material fashion, of course.

I'm also wondering if there is something on the Zenon roadmap represented by the term drive chain, and what that is.

We shouldnt use the term. Bitcoiners dont like it. Same as sidechains apparently. They associate changing Bitcoin's main chain with it
