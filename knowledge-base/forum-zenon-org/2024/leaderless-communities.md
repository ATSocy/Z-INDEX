Is there any historical exemple of leaderless community you're aware of ?

I'm discarding Bitcoin because Satoshi left a name, an ethos and a culture which has been paving the way for any decision making process when it comes to protocol upgrade.

Zenon has Mr. Kaine but this is at best the Walmart version so I'm also disregarding this.

Yes.

Can you feel it coming ?
