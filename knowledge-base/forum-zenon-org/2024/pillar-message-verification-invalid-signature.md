The verification doesn't seem to be working. Does the problem have something to do with how it autopopulates the message field on ZenonHub, with that string beginning with capital Z?

I’ll investigate when I get home this evening and post an update here, the messages were all signed correctly so I guess there’s an issue with the validator

There was an issue with the validator tool, this has been fixed now
