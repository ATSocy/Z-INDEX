I have the ability to extract top contributors to any GitHub repositories (their emails, job situation i.e. "open" for work). This list can then be used to contact them individually regarding the many [development needs](https://forum2.zenon.org/t/zenon-jobs-getting-started/807) / Accelerator-Z funding.

Given your understanding of the code, which project / GitHub repo devs would you like to see working on Zenon code?

The only community I follow closely is THORchain.  All the devs over there seem to work very hard and push a LOT of code.  Not sure if 9R would be into looking at Zenon.  But if they took an interest it could be very good for the project.

I think that‚Äôs not the right question to ask. There‚Äôs countless people able to work on the open tasks, given my understanding of the code. Unfortunately their mentality is difficult to measure that way. 

To quote the often cited bitcoin ethos, I‚Äôd like to see people with a <del>high</del> ups, low, time preference work on the project. I.e., looking for professionals to get the jobs done asap has not been the approach of the first three years, and I doubt if it should be going forward.

We need to target regardless and some project repos  could resemble to Zenon compared to others ie would we extract contributors from a frontend swap interface repo? Or do those skills not really match the skills the network needs atm to get us to next phases? I‚Äôm sure many of such devs are versatile enough to complete Zenon tasks, but in marketing you try to be as targeted as possible. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm asking to find professionals to work asap, but rather invite relevant minds to explore opportunities here.

I can go wild and export data from a ton of repos, being outbound is no different than putting a job post out and waiting for a fish to bite. So I believe that in order to be more granular and not waste time, it is the right question to ask so I know where to export and be outbound. A lot of methods to be used with lists, it‚Äôs the most common way to market for performance. If you‚Äôd like to understand better why I‚Äôm proposing / asking things, feel free to ask ‚Äî I‚Äôm always willing to explain üëçüèº

I probably come across a bit confrontative and unnessecarily so; don‚Äôt get me wrong if that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôm just trying to be productive and time efficient. And I know you‚Äôre too, and I did understand the motivation for this question. It makes sense, from where you‚Äôre coming from, as far as I can tell. 

From my perspective, targeted recruiting of (random) (professional) devs is suspicious, as it could create an environment where we progress on the technical front too fast, for the community to keep up with it. 
But that‚Äôs my view, as I want to see the tech and dev side embedded in the community, and not outsourced. 

As I‚Äôm not very affirmative of many marketing tactics, I should sometimes maybe better not say anything, but sometimes I feel it‚Äôs important for alternative views to be heard.

If I understand, what you're referring-to is long-term commitment from newcomers. I think it's to be expected that devs will come and go. At THORChain I've seen some top talent build incredible things, and leave for various reasons. They churned quite a bit of talent before the 9R team came and took a lot over (a little centralized though imo). 

Any new talent coming in will be guided to join community, collaborate and be committed to be around long-term. Will do my best to optimize funnels in a way where we can weed out the spammers from the serious potential contributors.

That sounds good and reasonable. I do like the way you pitch it in that welcome email.
