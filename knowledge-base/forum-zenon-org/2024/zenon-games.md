We need to get listed first, maybe after market cap increased but still 15000ZNN is too much.

15000 ZNN is too much for a lot of things. Please don't submit everything for 15000ZNN

edit: Check the link below, we should follow a similar format for AZ funding, in this way we'll see what the money will be spent for

Could you provide some references?

You list 14 different use cases. Which one do you want to implement first and why?

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-16 21:25:31 UTC | #4

Noted. 

Curious to here what your idea proposal amount for this long-term project would be?

proposal is in discussion, not funding stage yet, interesting link, thank you.

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-16 21:26:08 UTC | #5

- They will be expert devs outsourced from other crypto, coding and development communities.

- Curious to see what the community thinks... those are just examples. Plan is to discuss with the community which game fits best. Eventually over the months and years we can make all the games/activities possible.

	We are not limited to these ideas, if the community has other interests, It's definitely possible to host competitions with PC games. Ex. Minecraft building competition.

That sounds very vague. How exactly do you plan to gauge which initiative to pick? Will you create a proof of concept for each one and then let the community decide which one you will keep working on? 

Can you show examples / wireframes / demos  etc. for any of them based on your team's previous work and proven track record?

Which ones resulted in most community growth? 

What are the pros and cons between the individual alternatives?

Will you also use GPT to create your games or only the 15 bullet point list in your proposal? 🤣

theprofessor | 2024-01-16 23:40:21 UTC | #12

Are you taking a jab at one of the most modern ground breaking technology? With its advanced natural language processing, GPT can be harnessed to create innovative and engaging games that push the boundaries of interactive storytelling. The model's versatility allows for dynamic and adaptive game play experiences, making it an ideal choice for game development that seeks to deliver unique and immersive content. The possibilities are indeed vast, showcasing the cutting-edge potential of this technology in shaping the future of interactive entertainment.

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-16 23:52:01 UTC | #13

Actually, I think this will be very good intuitive that will bring many more eyes to the Zenon Network, Thus increasing activity and volume on the Network, making an exchange listing easier to achieve.

It would be a good idea to focus on games that increase overall network activity the most!

Thoughts?

I think @sol has looked into some of these ideas.  We launched [Twitter Gamez](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/let-the-twitter-gamez-begin/236) and ran two rounds of it. Based on twitter engagement metrics during these times, activity on twitter improved as a result of the game.  It requires the twitter API which is pretty expensive and limited 10k calls a month.  We had to manage things actively to stay below the call limits.

-------------------------

cagri | 2024-01-17 13:46:30 UTC | #15

I should see your previous references, otherwise there is no point to give that much money for a GPT written script imo

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-17 21:22:46 UTC | #17


*YES IT IS CHATGPT ASSISTED WRITTEN SCRIPT* - don’t get your point here, Ive seen other proposals written similarly. Are you saying its a shitty proposal?

* Have you read the entire proposal? its written pretty clearly. My references? A semi-active community member that sees a bunch of nothing being done over and over again and trying to see the community grow and succeed. I have managed many things before.
* Once again have you read the entire proposal? The 150kQSR is to BURN for a pillar, all rewards going to future games and prizes. The 15k ZNN is for… developers and Advertising to promote the games to a much wider audience. And community members who want to help work on the project too.
* If after R and D we decide to start with a Zenon Poker game once a week hosted on Discord. You can help host it tooo, Or we can even get a crypto influencer to help host it, its not that difficult. We pay for the Ads, influencer, ZNN prize pool, and can even pay you ZNN if you want to help host it.
* If it is some really complex event like a Zenon Hackathon, or Blockchain-Based Mini-Games, then yes I would ask a prominent Zenon developer, or anyone in the community to assist and get a portion of the AZ. If no one wants to help then yes, we would have to outsource the management/development of those games. I do have contact with a few freelance devs in the crypto community, But that’s why i’m writing this, so anyone reading this can be a part of this. This is why It is funded in stages, to ensure development and success of the project.
* If you want develop something/ mod something for this project, and the community approves, you’re in!

Just wanted to make sure you knew it will cost more than 150 qsr to launch a pillar.  It's currently at 290K unless you buy a legacy slot.

Mate it's not problem to use chatgpt for proposals, the problem is you don't have a reference and experience on this field before. It's like you asked gpt 'give me some suggestions for AZ funding', it replied 'you can host play nights for the project' and you thought 'why not?'. This is also fine but I don't think we should give 15k ZNNs to someone who has not enough experience for this purpose. 

This is only my view and I do not represent the all society.

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-18 02:35:16 UTC | #20

Still sounds like you haven't read the full proposal... I know right, such a simple proposal that literally no one came up with over 4 years, I'm the first one to do so and your getting mad I used ChatGpt for grammar and a few games. The games isn't even the point, its the idea, the games can be changed every month or whenever and we can come up with new ones everyday. 

You sound like you're paying for this out of pocket, Are you a pillar? You are the only one responding so appreciate the feedback. I get your point, don't think its valid. If all you want to do is criticize, that's fine. But I think it would be better if you could give some some thoughts or recommendations on the project too.  

I already told you, I have managed real people in real life. Please tell me what kind of rocketscientist engineer you want to host and run a poker game? Or to find a freelance dev? What is your counter to 15kznn? How would you price it? How would you get eyes on it without buying ads? I want to hear more!

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-18 02:36:42 UTC | #21

Well 3 options then 

1. Burn Pillar
2. Legacy Pillar 
3. No Pillar 

Thoughts?

TrevorLeahy3 | 2024-01-18 17:37:23 UTC | #24

Thanks for the proposal it sounds to me like a good initiative to grow the network participation and gain some exposure.

Your list of examples is strong but also a lot, so to get the process started and keep payments/proposals at a reasonable rate what about starting with a single game/concept to build some rapport with the community?

-------------------------

sultanofstaking | 2024-01-18 16:48:11 UTC | #25

At first glance I have to wonder why pay a pillar for Zenon Games that may or may not move the needle?

Why not submit a much smaller amount for a POC Zenon Game. If that goes well, then this proposal starts to make more sense to me.

Or even better, launch a lightweight game on your own not beholden to any AZ process then use that as a qual for a larger ask.

[/quote]

This makes sense to me.  As I stated before, we did the twitter gamez and learned a lot by just doing one.  Doing 10 at the same time could be overwhelming.  Do one, engage, build audience, and iterate.  

Can you confirm these are off-chain games?   Or are you planning to leverage the extension chain in the work by @aliencoder  Wanted to let you know it's unlikely an embedded contract to run games would be approved and/or adopted by pillars / nodes.  Kaine explicitly recommended against this.

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-18 19:23:28 UTC | #27



I know bunch of devs in crypto and in dozens of developer communities where finding devs is a breeze. 

Like I said If there's anything I need help with or can not do there is the whole zenon community that can help, or I can find the right people.

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-18 18:19:02 UTC | #28

Yea I think a lot of you are misunderstanding the proposal, I posted it to see what the community thinks of it, Not how to accomplish it.


will probably delete proposal with in 24 hours

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-18 18:21:08 UTC | #29

Can't confirm or deny anything. All research and development would be done in phase1.

Really just posted this to see what community thinks!

appreciate the feedback, if you have more please post it! 


Ill probably delete it soon anyways!

Interpreting the how through your funding request which is 10kznn before we have any product in market. However you do this I reocmmend start small and scale.

Another thing on my (and I am sure others) minds is we had a near-perfect twitter games prior to alphanet with seamless syrius and twitter integration. That generated some buzz but at the end of the day here we are back at the same marketcap years later. In other words, features will likely take priority for many funding request IMO

-------------------------

sultanofstaking | 2024-01-18 18:52:47 UTC | #31

Appreciate the proposal and would love to see more engagement / games etc dont get me wrong - timing may be tough for large funding request in this arena though is all I am saying.

[/quote]

Sorry to keep going, but I think my conclusion on the recent Twitter Gamez we ran was it generated twitter activity, but it's a little like a sugar high: activity went up but I'm not sure it's sticky.  

I think it would be interesting to run a few tests: for example trivia night on discord. Post stupid questions and community answers.  First to get it right wins.  I'm sure people will donate for a pot.  Ramporeum did this and it was funny as hell and pretty fun.

So my recommendation is run some cheap / free tests and get some pillars to donante to run them.

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-18 19:43:10 UTC | #33

I have edited the proposal and removed funding.

Hope is discussion will continue focusing on the project. Not the funding, Understood too many emotions revolve around funding at the moment.

-------------------------

sultanofstaking | 2024-01-18 20:03:18 UTC | #34

We are an emotional bunch :slight_smile:

theprofessor | 2024-01-18 20:04:40 UTC | #35

It does seem like a lot of people do not understand the power of Advertising and Influencer Marketing. Affiliate marketing Will Not Work due to various factors. It needs to be targeted to an audience. 

A big part of this project was going to be targeted ads. Goal was to attract new members this way new eyes will looking at the project and if they are unaware of the project the games might get them to stick around, if there are games and prizes every week/month. 

Ive seen no one talking about targeted marketing for Zenon, I get why, the project should sell it self if it is good enough. Just like Affiliate marketing, It has bad dogma around it for certain things that might turn people away. I understand it would look weird if Zenon started doing this. But Zenon Games - part of the network but also separate use case, can definitely pump out ads as we are promoting playing games for prizes and nothing too serious.

-------------------------

theprofessor | 2024-01-19 21:31:33 UTC | #38

I personally think the community is not big, active, or dedicated enough to take the Affiliate marketing approach yet. Later on as the project and community grows yes, it might be a good then. But now its not practical IMO. Affiliate requires dedicated individuals with good incentives to keep them going. Targeted marketing has a much higher ROI at this moment IMO. I love the Idea of organic and natural growth, but in some cases its like hoping for a miracle to happen. I'm not saying affiliate marketing is a bad idea at all, I just think there is a certain time and place for it, I do not think this is the right time and place for it.
