I added 3 new sections to the left side pane:

- `Discover`: external link to Zenon.Org for education purposes, and beneath it a link to the BTC States funnel. A new use case section will be created on the .Org website and will highlight BTC States
-` Socials`: external links to Zenon.Org and Zenon Network community socials.
- â•° [BTC States](https://forum.zenon.org/c/zenon/btc-states/36) beneath `Zenon`: The intent is to bring discussions about The Network State / BTC State into the Zenon ecosystem.
