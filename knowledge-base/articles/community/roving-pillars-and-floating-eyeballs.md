In this article, I would like to introduce a new project to all my crypto bros. Few crypto OGs are already aware of this mysterious project but there are still many who have never heard of it and need to discover [Zenon Network](https://zenon.network/). Zenon went public with a [bitcointalk forum thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4281633.msg38564494) in late Q1 2019. With a product-ready branding, a sleek and attractive website with custom graphics, a relatively unique distribution mechanism, an interesting lightpaper and a completely anonymous team, they were claiming that they are reinventing distributed ledger technology a.k.a. DLT. Let’s take a quick look at the facts and rumours.

**Facts**

Let’s start with what we have. We have a nicely designed website with an anonymous team, a lightpaper, a bitcointalk announcement, few medium articles, a thriving community with crypto OGs and a working wallet (PIVX fork which was a Bitcoin fork). This wallet is a placeholder wallet and it’s here just for the purpose of the initial distribution. They propose a novel consensus protocol and a new foundational network architecture called _the_ _Network of Momentum_ which is linearly scalable, resistant to Sybil attacks, tolerates Byzantine adversaries. It will also feature an existing Turing-complete scripting language that will enable zApp development without any special setup. This new decentralized architecture will involve a peer-to-peer mesh of nodes that cryptographically verify _Momentum Proofs_.

Basically, it will be a public permissionless ledger based on a novel and secure sharding protocol. It will be different from blockchain implementations by not gathering transactions in batches and having a non-probabilistic finality. They are assuming an independent transaction model where execution of transactions can be done in any order if they are not dependent on each other and if they exist in different shards while generating the same final state. There will be different types of nodes called _Pillars_ and _Sentinels,_ each type for different purposes as inter shard communication or dictating the global consensus. The network will be deployed in a two-step process known as “Pillar Formation” and “Network Genesis” respectively. Between two steps there will be the Momentum Network’s testnet with exclusive participation access only to locked-in Pillars. (Block 385920 will be the end of Pillar Lock-in and there are 132 Pillars secured as of this writing)

We observe a non-academic approach in their [lightpaper](https://zenon.network/res/lightpaper.pdf), rather a basic summary of their plans. Although they did not mention it in their lightpaper, we know from their website that they are even planning a satellite program into outer-space in the pursue for a greater decentralization.

No code or mathematical demonstration for the Network of Momentum can be seen yet, but their wallet was here since the very first day and can be found in [their github](https://github.com/zenonnetwork). They claim that a more academic paper with all technical details will be distributed through a set of official academic channels.

**Rumours**

This is where things start to get interesting. Zenon comes with its own legend. [This is where](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5185543) I first saw these rumours. There are amazing coincidences (or clues?) which link this anonymous project to [Square Crypto](https://twitter.com/sqcrypto). I’ll tell you my favorite three among them:

*   Both Zenon Network & Square Crypto sent their first tweets on the same day, the 21st of March, 2019; which is Twitter’s birthday
*   Both Zenon Network & Square Crypto are following only one legendary person: [Hal Finney](https://twitter.com/halfin)
*   Square Crypto is famous with its enigmatic tweets but probably the most interesting one is [the one](https://twitter.com/sqcrypto/status/1112877431667519495) about “roving pillar of shimmering blue light and a thousand floating eyeballs”

Roving pillars of shimmering blue light and floating eyeballs on Zenon’s website

I must say that the admins in Zenon Network’s Telegram group are denying those weird connections in the name of decentralization, they don’t want to get affiliated with any known third parties. This is honestly quite understandable. On the other hand, Square Crypto is not responding in any way to those allegations. It’s up to you to decide if no denial means something or not. Also some early community members are suggesting that the initial distribution mechanism (called xStakes) may be operating through some kind of (unseen) bitcoin smart contracts. [Here](https://medium.com/@shaimo/the-zenon-enigma-782f8b293bd6) you can read a more detailed story of Zenon Network from a very early community member’s perspective.

**Conclusion**

As you can see we have an interestingly mysterious project in front of us. Why do you think they have chosen Zenon as their name? In my opinion, it is because the pre-Socratic philosopher, a member of Parmenides’ Eleatic School, **Zenon of Elea** was famous with challenging, inspiring and puzzling paradoxes! Zenon Network is redefining crypto narratives by re-using the oldest and strongest method in the space: Satoshiesque mystery. That’s why those rumours may stay as rumours forever and paradoxically this anonymous team may eventually deliver a killer DLT. Crypto means enigma, puzzle and mystery. It all fits well. I’m pretty sure many of you will choose to remain skeptic because of your PTSD in this mentally and emotionally challenging ecosystem but I must say that as someone who has encountered with Bitcoin way back in 2011, Zenon Network created a strong _back-to-roots_ feeling in my whole existence. Excited and fingers crossed…
