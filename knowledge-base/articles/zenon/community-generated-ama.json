	"content": "Edition 1. Covering general aspects and future of Zenon\n\nWe have gathered questions from our community members, which we decided to answer and integrate into a Medium article. In this way, the information will not be lost in the chat archive, and new community members can be directed to this AMA for clarification.\n\n1. (Q) Is the new coin a separate PIVX fork at this point? Or does it take place on the NoM only?\n(A) QSR is part of the dual coin mechanism that will power NoM. It will be available on Syrius wallet during the alphanet.\n\n2. (Q) Will QSR be tradable?\n(A) Yes, it will be tradable.\n\n3. (Q) What is the max supply of QSR? Besides pillar locks, what other mechanisms will be used to burn it, and do you know at what rate or percentages of a transaction?\n(A) There won’t be a max supply until NoM mainnet. QSR burn will only serve to create additional Pillar slots.\n\n4. (Q) So… No time limit to keep the node running after the 1st snapshot in order to get the airdrop? E.g Can I just set up a node before each snapshot and turn it off right after and still get the rewards?\n(A) In order to participate in the lock-drop, one needs to keep the Node(s)/Pillar(s) up and running during each snapshot. No other restrictions.\n\n5. (Q) Why did they make us wait 30 days for this announcement? Is the alphanet very close? Before or after the lock-drop?\n(A) We want to make sure Quasar is evaluated from every point of view and this approach is time-consuming. After the lock-drop period ends a swap will take place, and it marks the first phase of NoM.\n\n6. (Q) Is there a new wallet version between now and the first snapshot?\n(A) No. Syrius wallet will be available after the swap.\n\n7. (Q) What is the amount of QSR/ZNN stakers, nodes, and pillars will earn for their services?\n(A) After the lock-drop ends, we will provide additional information regarding the exact numbers.\n\n8. (Q) Will ZNN have other purposes besides locking in for nodes and pillars?\n(A) In NoM, ZNN will also be used for regular transactions between peers.\n\n9. (Q) Will a pillar infrastructure update i.e. moving to a new host/setup cost us a QSR burn (as we don’t unlock ZNN during that process, but do effectively generate a new key). So is the QSR burn for a new lock? Or is the QSR burn for a new setup?\n(A) No, the burning of QSR is needed only to secure a Pillar slot. More technical info will be available before the alphanet is live.\n\n10. (Q) Will current pillar holders have to burn the 150k QSR they receive in order to “create” their same pillars on the NoM, or is the QSR burn only for *new* pillars coming after the initial 136? Whether the current queue system will remain in place for existing pillar slots? If, for example, there is already someone waiting in queue, will he be eligible for the airdrop?\n(A) Yes, existing Pillars will need to burn 150000 QSR to create their slot on the alphanet. Pillars from the queue will need to adhere to the following formula: max(0, (number_of_pillars — 136 + 1)) * 10000 + 150000 (QSR)\n\n11. (Q) Will the team actively look for clients to use the network protocol to build Zapps, besides project incubator?\n(A) Ecosystem expansion is what we always take into consideration. We will continue to seek new opportunities after the NoM mainnet is live.\n\n12. (Q) How does Zenon plan to run apps from legacy web in web3?\n(A) We will investigate ways to automatically convert legacy web apps into zApps after the NoM mainnet is live.\n\n13. (Q) What are the special requirements for running NoM nodes?\n(A) Depending on the type of nodes one will run, there will be different requirements for example: Pillar operators will need to stay competitive in attracting hashrate and participate in the consensus algorithm, Sentinel nodes will need to assemble PoW links and will also have the possibility to run zApps, while Sentries will mainly act as observers and have lighter requirements. In-depth specifications will be available as we approach NoM mainnet.\n\n14. (Q) Is the peer review for the whitepaper still on track?\n(A) We will focus on delivering the yellow paper, and we’re aiming to get it peer-reviewed.\n\n15. (Q) What signature scheme does Zenon use?\n(A) It currently uses Bitcoin’s ECDSA. Regarding NoM, we are investigating alternative signature schemes such as BLS or Schnorr and ones that are quantum resistant.\n\n16. (Q) Any exchange planned?\n(A) After the alphanet is live.\n\n17. (Q) Can you elaborate on this from the whitepaper as it helps us understand infrastructure requirements better, I quote: “In order for the pillars to be competitive [..]”?\n(A) Starting with NoM, Pillar operators will have the possibility to set up PoW pools to secure the network and share the rewards with the peers feeding them hashrate.\n\n18. (Q) Will Zenon provide consensus as a service to other chains?\n(A) We’ll explore this possibility after NoM mainnet is live.\n\n19. (Q) How do the nodes choose other nodes for the passing of powlink? Defining randomness is usually tough on-chain.\n(A) The randomness is obtained off-chain.\n\n20. (Q) A 2-layer architecture is quite heavy for small projects. What is the ideal project or size of an app in terms of volume, users, etc. to use on Zenon?\n(A) Our aim is that any dApp, regardless of size, can be converted into a zApp.\n\n21. (Q) What’s zx distribution algorithm that was mentioned in the btctalk ann for xstakes? What will it do in the NoM?\n(A) ZX distribution Algo was built especially to create ZNN in its inception. If there will also be a use of it in NoM, we will integrate it for sure.\n\n22. (Q) How will the transition to Nom take place from this pivx placeholder?\n(A) Via a swap process.\n\n23. (Q) Can we have adaptive governance according to market conditions on the number of zenon required for setting up a node? Cause in today’s price it costs us 15k USD maybe 1 year down the line it will cost us 50k USD; wouldn’t that hinder decentralization? We could vote after each quarter what number of zenons are required to set up new nodes? Could this be done?\n(A) Yes, our core objective is to boost network decentralization; our aim is to implement an updated governance framework for the NoM mainnet. We are already tackling this issue: for instance, QSR’s primary purpose is to increase the number of available Pillar slots in a neutral and decentralized manner.\n\n24. (Q) What sort of toolings, framework are being built for using the network?\n(A) At the moment, we’re focusing on the core components of the alphanet. After that, we’ll shift to focus on integrations and dev support. Everything that is being developed will be open source and available on public repos.\n\n25. (Q) Maybe the team’s responses can be incorporated into an updated Medium article so that new people coming to the project have all the info\n(A) We’ll post this AMA thread as a separate Medium article.\n\n26. (Q) Are transactions on the NoM final? And if yes, how.\n(A) The finality of transactions is a delicate subject for decentralized systems. In NoM architecture, transactions will have asymptotically finality similar to Bitcoin’s confirmations; settled transactions will be orders of magnitude harder to revert than in traditional blockchain implementations.\n\n27. (Q) Did you have the opportunity to run some early benchmarks on the NoM, and if yes, are the results fitting what you expected?\n(A) After the alphanet, we will conduct benchmarks before NoM launch and share the results.\n\n28. (Q) How do you plan to proceed with the public alphanet? Will there be incentives and different for the most active participants?\n(A) Yes, the incentives are described in the Medium article we already posted.\n\nThank you for participating in Zenon community generated AMA. We aim to do this more often as we proceed with the development.\n\nFor more questions feel free to ask admins on our official Telegram group.\n\nhttps://t.me/zenonnetwork",
