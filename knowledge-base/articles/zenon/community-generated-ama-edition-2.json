	"content": "Covering: Network of Momentum, Alphanet, and the future of Zenon.\n\n1) Hi there, how will the swap for ZNN token to NoM take place?\n\nA) To avoid confusion, ZNN and QSR are coins, not tokens. Moreover, the swap procedure is designed to be user-friendly and easy for everyone to execute. More information about the swap process will be available before the Alphanet launch on all public communications channels.\n\n2) On the last video you tweeted it showed a ‘Plasma’ tab on the interface of the SYRIUS wallet, What’s Plasma about? Is Zenon a sidechain for Ethereum? Q3. Is Zenon able to interact with Bitcoin? How?\n\nA) Plasma is a built-in anti-spam mechanism designed for Alphanet. Zenon will always operate as an independent crypto-system. In NoM Phase 1, we will focus on interoperability with Bitcoin using novel cryptographic approaches that will leverage signatures, hash locks, and time locks.\n\n3) Does Syrius mean serious? Does Bitcoin chain feature in the architecture? A constant related to BTC block at time was placed in ZNN genesis block? Will Zenon Alphanet help run smart contracts on BTC? xStakes gave this idea, was it a smart contract algo?\n\nA) The name S y r i u s is derived from Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. For Zenon, S y r i u s represents a state-of-the-art wallet on which anybody can easily store, stake, or manage their ZNN, QSR, and ZTS tokens. We like that our followers have eagle eyes. Bitcoin will always have a special place in all our current or future endeavors.\n\n4) “For the first part of the Zenon Fabric program, we have reserved 10 vested Pillar slots for key industry players.” — how many ZNN/Pillars are you allocating for Zenon Fabric except the 10 vested Pillars? Is it part of the total supply or will you increase the total supply?\n\nA) Zenon Fabric will provide ZNN for 10 Vested Pillars Slots every 83 days that will be available for key industry players. Each Vesting Event will last 7 days and will coincide with the revoke window for Pillars. Any non-assigned slot will expire, and new ones will be available during the next Vesting Event. The ZNN used for the Vested Pillars is extracted from Zenon Structure. There will not be an increase in the total supply for this process.\n\n5) Are you releasing the code with Alphanet? What about the extended white/yellow paper?\n\nA) Every codebase that is used in production will be available on public git repos. We aim to publish an extended white/yellow paper after the swap process is over.\n\n6) What is Plasma in the new wallet?\n\nA) Plasma represents a built-in anti-spam mechanism designed for the Network of Momentum — Alphanet.\n\n7) Why don’t you reveal who you are? Is there a power behind you? Will there be a new listing?\n\nA) The power behind us is the community. We chose to remain anonymous because there can be no true decentralization with a public figure in charge. Listings will follow soon after Alphanet migration.\n\n8) When Alphanet? Can we have an approximate date?\n\nA) We expect to release a private testnet with the Alphanet applicants by the end of the year.\n\n9) Who are the industrial partners? What value will they add to the ecosystem that existing pillar owners do not?\n\nA) Creating partnerships is crucial for the ecosystem’s expansion by merging knowledge and communities. After the Alphanet release, we will reveal information about their work and involvement within the ecosystem.\n\n10) What is going to be the first use-case of Network of Momentum?\n\nA) The first use-case of NoM would be to power decentralized infrastructure services that will support further development of next-gen web3 applications.\n\n11) Is there a fixed quantity of non-legacy Pillars that can be added to the network? If yes what determines their assurance for a spot? First come first serve?\n\nA) There is no upper bound for non-legacy Pillar slots. The generation of every new Pillar slot will require the operator to burn 10k more QSR than the previous one.\n\n12) Is it possible to easily migrate a current central APP to the Zenon network? Does Zenon network scalability meet this migration requirement?\n\nA) We envision a future where every centralized application can benefit from decentralized solutions like identity services, grid computing, etc.\n\n13) When Alphanet migration instructions?\n\nA) Alphanet migration instructions will be available after the window dedicated to the private testnet is closed.\n\n14) What was the Inception that would happen in October?\n\nA) Delivering a complex product can sometimes require more time than it was planned. We want to make sure our final version of Alphanet is accurate from all development standpoints and that the transition to it is flawless.\n\n15) Are we going to have the mobile version of Syrius initially?\n\nA) The desktop version will be released first, with plans for a Web version in early 2021 and a Mobile version in the second half of 2021.\n\n16) Who, in your opinion, are your biggest competitor(s)?\n\nA) The cryptocurrency space has evolved from competition-driven to partnership focused. So, we are continually looking to consolidate our community by merging the Network of Momentum with other ecosystems.\n\n17) In which markets do you see zApps being fitted? I can’t tell what the technology will be most ideal-for yet.\n\nA) zApps are designed to bring a fusion between the best of both worlds: the performance and efficiency of a centralized solution with the privacy and security of a decentralized system.\n\n18) Since Syrius will be available on mobile phones, would we able to stake via the phone. Or is it limited to only PC.\n\nA) Yes, it will be mintable using any compatible device that is connected to the network.\n\n19) What will be the program language for Alphanet? Will it be the same for both coins and the token?\n\nA) The code is written in Go, but SDKs will be provided for the most popular programming languages.",
