	"content": "Securing a Pillar\n\nThe time to secure Network of Momentum’s foundation is approaching.\n\nThe following article is intended to provide a brief understanding of how one can be a part of NoM’s foundation by securing a Pillar during the lock-in phase.\n\nPillar Lock-in phase will only last from block 365670 until block 385920 for an approximate period of two weeks.\n\nIn order to make the procedure as simple as possible, users will have to undergo the same actions as when creating a regular Node except that Pillar nodes will require a collateral of 15,000 ZNN.\n\nNo additional Pillars can be deployed after the end of the lock-in period.\n\nHowever, if a new network participant wants to set up a Pillar after the lock-in period, the only possibility will be to join the queue and wait for an existing Pillar to shut down and spend the collateral before taking its place.\n\nBeing one of Network of Momentum’s Pillars means more than just holding a valid collateral. Pillars will be the first network participants to experience the Network of Momentum testnet, as well as having development voting rights once it is released. Pillar nodes will have four times the weight of a regular node.\n\nIn order to ensure that every participant experiences a flawless lock-in phase, technical support will be increased on our social channels during the Pillar Lock-in phase.",
