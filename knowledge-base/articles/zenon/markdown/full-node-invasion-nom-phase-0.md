Blockchains are going to run the world by providing mechanisms for scaling social and economic cooperation to unprecedented levels. However, most of the existing layer-1 projects provide only a shallow decentralization.

A blockchain network where users are unable to run their own nodes is not essentially trust-less, but relies on centralized entities to feed them data.

**_One of the key fundamentals of blockchain decentralization is enabling users to run full nodes and validate transaction history without reliance on third parties.We’re uncovering better ways to enrich genuine decentralization by invading the space with more nodes and help others to do it as well._**

Running a **Zenon node on the NoM protocol** offers by far the **best security and privacy** **guarantees** while ensuring that the dual-ledger data is secure, valid, and accessible.

This article will explain what is a node, why you should run one, how to do it and future developments insights.

## **What is a node?**

A node can be basically any device that runs the node daemon, it is communicating via a peer to peer network with other devices that run the NoM software client to enable the following functions:
**•** Storing & validating the dual-ledger transaction data
**•** Relaying proper information to other nodes
**•** Following and enforcing the NoM protocol

## Why run a node?

_“Trusted third parties are security holes” — Nick Szabo._

The saying _“not your keys, not your coins”_ also extends to blockchain consensus as **_“not your nodes, not your rules”_**. Running a full node guarantees that you can self-verify transactions and enforce protocol rules, so you can’t be deceived #UASF.

**_Here are the top extensive benefits for running your own Zenon node:_**

**_•_ Security:**
Even a third party that is established and relatively trustworthy can still be compromised by malicious entities. By running and using a full node to validate transactions, users can protect themselves against a wide range of attacks. More exotic attack vectors inherent to p2p networks like eclipse attacks might occur with low probability, but can be mitigated as well. Besides, an honest node that follows the protocol will always relay properly validated data.
**_•_ Privacy:**
Full nodes offer the most comprehensive privacy guarantees. When you’re using a third party node, you’re exposing sensitive data (IP address and other metadata) to a centralized entity that can be used to fingerprint you. By using a full node, the transactions are directly relayed to other nodes and is harder to associate a transaction to you beside the available on-chain data.
**_•_ Decentralization:**
More full nodes translates into enhanced connectivity for users across the world, so better geographical distribution. In order to further strengthen decentralization, it is recommended to be your own ISP avoiding certain types of network filtering and deploying off grid connectivity systems (Starlink, goTenna, Helium).
**_•_ Censorship resistance:**
Your transactions will never get dropped or censored.
**_•_ No downtime:**
Not depending on third party nodes, you’re controlling the full node and use it whenever you need.

## How to setup and use a full node?

**1\. Build a node binary from the source.
_The codebase is written in Go_**_,_ so it is targeting a wide variety of CPU architectures and operating systems. It is designed to even run on low-end or power-constrained devices such as _Raspberry Pi._

**2\. Set up the node.
**Some operating systems may require additional permissions to allow the execution of the node. Go through the necessary steps if that’s the case.

**3\. Use it alongside S y r i u s wallet.
**Connect the S y r i u s wallet to your full node from the node management widget from the settings panel.

## **Future developments in Q1 2022**

**_•_ S y r i u s will feature an embedded node**, so that even non-technical users will benefit from the same security and privacy guarantees as pro users.
**_•_** Node optimizations that will **improve overall resource efficiency.**
