# Intro

From time to time, the question of Zenon’s use-cases is being addressed. As we are approaching important milestones, it is time to explain why fixing Zenon under a specific use-case can only be a limitation to what the Network of Momentum aims to achieve.

The hybrid applications built on Zenon will fall under a variety of use-cases, covering anything from decentralized storage solutions to DeFi or IoT.

# The to-go framework for zApp developers

To describe the matter as simple as possible, Zenon aims to be the “to-go” framework for developers researching better tools and environments and for users seeking superior utilization experiences. A vibrant place for native tokens created on NoM or a new home for tokens shifting to the Zenon Token Standard but also for the zApps being built on the Network of Momentum.

# Approaching milestones

Step by step we are getting close to start unveiling years of ongoing protocol development, which is only the beginning. A premiere dual-coin mechanism, a state of the art wallet hosting ZNN, QSR, ZTS and various SDKs built for zApp developers, all powered by a decentralized network where users are finally in charge.

If we need to limit the scope of Zenon and the Network of Momentum under a single specific use-case, the following one should be the most appropriate — a robust platform designed to unlock a new dimension of possibilities for apps.
