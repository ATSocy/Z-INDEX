After receiving several requests from the community, we’re thrilled to announce the Wrapped ZNN Liquidity Program featuring a 100.000.000 Plasma Points incentive fund ready to be claimed by liquidity providers.

Liquidity is essential for enabling a healthy and prospering decentralized ecosystem. As so, in this article we are taking you through the details of this Liquidity Program, the importance of obtaining Plasma Points ($PP), and the step-by-step guide on using Zenon BSC Liquidity Pool.

Zenon has created the one-way bridge on BSC by providing wrapped Zenon (wZNN) and allowing anyone to provide liquidity to the $wZNN-BSC pool. The LPs (Liquidity Providers) will earn trading fees from the pool and $PP — the only ZTS token convertible to $QSR at Alphanet launch.

By providing more liquidity, Zenon stands to win more conversions in the market which generates more fees & $PP for LPs.

## How many Plasma Points are allocated for the Liquidity Program?

As mentioned before, $PP along with $QSR will be a critical and limited asset after Alphanet Launch. One of the few ways to generate $PP that will subsequently generate $QSR is by providing liquidity. You can find below the $PP rewards distribution:

-   Total Liquidity incentives: 100.000.000 $PP
-   Daily Liquidity incentives: 1.785.715 $PP
-   Liquidity Program duration: 56 days

## Instructions for the wZNN Liquidity Program

> Note: wZNN Liquidity Program starts on September 24th

1.  [Get wZNN from PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c&outputCurrency=0x84b174628911896a3b87fa6980d05dbc2ee74836) or by [swapping ZNN to wZNN](https://medium.com/p/272538cde1a7) at [bridge.zenon.network](https://bridge.zenon.network/).
2.  Add liquidity to the [wZNN/WBNB PancakeSwap pair](https://pancakeswap.finance/add/0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c/0x84b174628911896a3b87fa6980d05dbc2ee74836).
3.  Navigate to [bridge.zenon.network](https://bridge.zenon.network/) and pick wZNN Liquidity Program from the main menu.
4.  Paste your Zenon Public Incentivized Testnet address and click Submit.
5.  The Web3 wallet will ask for permission to sign a message. Confirm the action to continue.
6.  Done. If everything went well you should see a confirmation message.

## Considerations

-   Make sure you have the LP tokens in the Web3 wallet address you’re connected to.
-   Once you associate your BSC address with your Zenon Public Incentivized Testnet address, this can’t be changed.
-   The $PP are distributed every 24 hours after 00:00 UTC. Make sure you have added liquidity to the wZNN/WBNB PancakeSwap pair before the next rewards cycle.
