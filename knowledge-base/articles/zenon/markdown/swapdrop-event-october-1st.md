**The SwapDrop is an incentivized test swap** designed specifically for the Zenon Public Incentivized Testnet. The same swap procedure that will be used during the Alphanet Cycles will be tested with a minor change: the decay algorithm will not be present.

This procedure will swap legacy wallet assets (**without affecting the legacy network balances)** to Zenon Public Incentivized Testnet assets (tZNN and tQSR) that implements the new Alphanet wallet format. **A bonus of 100 PP** (Plasma Points) will be credited for **every legacy ZNN that was successfully swapped into tZNN**. **_1000 PP=1QSR_**

Every participant will be able to test the swap and migrate their assets from the legacy network to the Zenon Public Incentivized Testnet.

The swap wallet exported from ZenonCore contains all your legacy addresses and associated **private keys** in an encrypted format. **Be extra careful when dealing with wallet files, beware of scammers and never share any private information with anyone!**

# SwapDrop tutorial

1.  First open the legacy wallet: ZenonCore v1.6.5
2.  Navigate to File -\> Export Swap Wallet in order to export the legacy wallet.dat into the proper swap wallet format (“.swp”)
3.  Encrypt the swap wallet file with the encryption key of your legacy wallet.dat file; choose a location to save it
4.  Open Syrius wallet v4.0.0 or later
5.  Navigate to Settings -\> Wallet Options -\> Swap wallet
6.  Read and accept the SwapDrop notice in order to proceed with the swap
7.  Import the “.swp” wallet file that you’ve exported earlier; it must have the proper extension: “.swp”
8.  Decrypt the “.swp” wallet file with the key from step 3
9.  Swap the legacy funds by selecting the testnet addresses
10. Check your tZNN, tQSR and Plasma Points balances on the Zenon Public Incentivized Testnet

The legacy assets (ZNN and QSR, if applicable) will be swapped into testnet coins (tZNN and tQSR, if applicable) **without affecting the legacy network balances.**

> **If you participated in the Quasar Lockdrop and there are any issues, please reach out on the community channels for support.**

Before initiating the swap procedure, make sure you have a **backup for the Public Incentivized Testnet wallet**.
