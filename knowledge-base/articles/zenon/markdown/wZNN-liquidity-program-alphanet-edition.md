The **2-way bridge** with BSC (BNB Chain) has been released, which means that anyone can swap wZNN to ZNN and vice-versa.

Liquidity is a crucial factor for all operations in DeFi, such as token swaps, lending or borrowing. Low liquidity levels for a specific token may lead to volatility and conversely, high liquidity means that heavy price swings are less likely.

The **wZNN Liquidity Program — Alphanet Edition** has started right after the _#AlphanetBigBang_ and is currently live.

As the _Public Incentivized Testnet_ had 1.800.000 QSR unclaimed, they will be redistributed to LPs on Alphanet, with up to **10x daily rewards multiplier.**

## Liquidity providers rewarding system:

Starting date: November 24th.
Total Liquidity incentives: 1.800.000 QSR.
Daily Liquidity incentives: Up to 18.000 QSR if the 10x multiplier is achieved.

## Instructions for becoming a liquidity provider:

1\. Get wZNN on PancakeSwap or by swapping ZNN to wZNN at [**bridge.zenon.network**](https://bridge.zenon.network/)

2\. Add liquidity to the **wZNN/WBNB** **PancakeSwap pair.**

3\. Paste your **ZNN address** and click Submit

4\. Navigate to [**bridge.zenon.network**](https://bridge.zenon.network/) and click wZNN Liquidity Program in the main menu.

5\. The **Web3 wallet (e.g. MetaMask)** will ask for permission to sign a message. Confirm the action to continue.

6\. Done, you should see a confirmation message.
_Note: Once the BSC (BNB Chain) address is associated with a ZNN address, this can’t be changed._

## Considerations:

• Make sure you have the LP tokens in the Web3 wallet address you’re connected to.

• Once you associate your BSC (BNB Chain) address with your ZNN address, this can’t be changed.

• The QSR are distributed every 24 hours after 12:00 UTC. Make sure you have added liquidity to the wZNN/WBNB PancakeSwap pair before the next rewards cycle.

Get your QSR rewards!
