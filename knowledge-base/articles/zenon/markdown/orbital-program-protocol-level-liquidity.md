Alphanet Big Bang is closer than ever. This game-changing development represents a vast universe where anyone can create, store, exchange, and monetize any type of asset in a decentralized, secure, and scalable manner.

This article approaches the following subjects: the upgraded coin metrics and a glimpse of a new upcoming program turning into reality after the Alphanet is released.

An important step towards decentralization has been made before the Alphanet launch by providing experimental support for the wrapped ZNN (wZNN) in a one-way BSC (Binance Smart Chain) Bridge.

One of the features for the Alphanet is protocol-level interoperability and further expansion of the ecosystem by following a multi-chain path. The goal towards true decentralization and coin accessibility can be accomplished by building bridges with other ecosystems.

**Coin metrics**

Network of Momentum was designed with a robust and self-sustainable coin economy where participants can thrive through multiple incentivization systems aligned with the security and decentralization provided by the underlying architecture.

> **The Alphanet coin metrics is balancing both inflationary and deflationary forces. To better understand them, let’s dive deeper into NoM’s actors:**
>
> **Pillars:** requires both ZNN and QSR (requires Pillar Slot, the QSR is burned) with rewards in ZNN
>
> **Sentinels:** requires both ZNN and QSR (requires Sentinel Slot, the QSR locked) with rewards in both ZNN & QSR
>
> **Delegators:** requires \>1 ZNN, rewards in ZNN
>
> **Staking:** requires \>1 ZNN, rewards in QSR

An important mention here: Pillar and Sentinel actors represent active participants at the network level, while delegators and staking are passive. Pillars are directly participating in the consensus protocol. Sentinels will play a key role in the network infrastructure, while delegators have a role in determining the rank of the Pillars and staking is entirely virtual from a network perspective.

Moreover, there are also additional deflationary forces spinning around the network. An ever-increasing number of QSR is burned whenever a Pillar Slot is created. Issuing a ZTS token requires burning 1 ZNN.

**Orbital Program: Protocol Level Liquidity**

In order to create a more prosperous and inclusive environment for both the network and its participants, we’re introducing Orbital Program: protocol level liquidity.

This will incentivize current and new participants to provide cross-chain liquidity with dual-rewards. This new incentivization mechanism is designed to keep a fair distribution depending on the value added into the network.

**The Protocol Level Liquidity Program implies that a fraction of all network rewards will be collected and further on can be redistributed by an embedded smart contract in a trustless and censorship-resistant way.**

_Initially, this fraction will be set at 15% ZNN & 25% QSR of the total dual-coin emission and the chains with the corresponding liquidity pools will be decided by the Pillars._

**The main takeaways from this novel direction are:**

• Ensuring sustainable liquidity provision for the ecosystem

• Increasing the ecosystem accessibility

• Merging communities and attracting people from other ecosystems

• Expanding the protocol-level interoperability

> **Dual-coin emission\* as shown in the figure below:**
>
> **Pillars:** 50% of ZNN rewards
> **Sentinels:** 13% of ZNN & 25% of QSR rewards
> **Delegators:** 24% of ZNN rewards
> **Stakers:** 50% of QSR rewards
> **Protocol Level Liquidity:** 13% of ZNN & 25% of QSR rewards
>
> _\*Dual-coin emission remains intact_
