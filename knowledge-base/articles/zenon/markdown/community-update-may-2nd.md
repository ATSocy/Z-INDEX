**March marked the month of Zenon’s Network launch.**

After the distribution successfully concluded, it is time to fully focus on development and academic research but also on building a loyal and vibrant community which is without a doubt, one of the greatest assets a cryptocurrency project can posses.

Communities which grow extremely fast are often deficient on fundamental essentials, leaving them vulnerable in the long-term to competition.

A constant and steady growth makes for a powerful foundation to build upon; Build a strong base, and the community will follow.

One of Zenon’s first major goals was to make the launch as fair as possible, prioritizing decentralization while still maintaining an overall different approach of a cryptocurrency project. In order to make Zenon’s launch even more fair, starting from May, “the stability fund” will be equally distributed among all active nodes.

## NETWORK STABILITY FUND DISTRIBUTION

When Zenon’s network was created, a total of 70,001 ZNN were generated in order to sustain the network for a limited period of time, until it was able to support itself. Now, Zenon’s network is expanding every day as new nodes are constantly joining the network.

In order to express gratitude to the network participants in a fun and captivating way, a cryptogram was created with the first part of the “stability fund” using 10.500 ZNN split in 5 private keys that were unlocked by our determined community members.

The distribution was successfully completed, the network is now self sustainable, and now, we are ready to start our second reward phase of the remaining stability fund.

In a decentralized network, every participant is essential to the well being of the project. Starting from block 84960, all node owners will be the main users which will benefit from the “stability fund”, for a total period of 12 months. Each month 4,958 ZNN will be equally distributed among all active Zenon Nodes at a specific block (multiple of 43200).

59500 / 12 / number of total nodes active at the specified block

\* Rewards can vary according to number of active Nodes at the moment of distribution

\* All Nodes are eligible if they are active at the moment of distribution.

As a project that is meant to be fully decentralized, its community is not only a major component, but the key and heart of the project.

Because no living entity can exist without a heart, we want to hear you out, as creative ideas and feedback are always appreciated and taken in consideration.
