# Securing a Pillar

The time to secure Network of Momentum’s foundation is approaching.

The following article is intended to provide a brief understanding of how one can be a part of NoM’s foundation by securing a Pillar during the lock-in phase.

Pillar Lock-in phase will only last from **block 365670 until block 385920** for an approximate period of two weeks.

In order to make the procedure as simple as possible, users will have to undergo the same actions as when creating a regular Node except that Pillar nodes will require a collateral of **_15,000 ZNN_**.

_No additional Pillars can be deployed after the end of the lock-in period._

However, if a new network participant wants to setup a Pillar after the lock-in period, the only possibility will be to join the queue and wait for an existing Pillar to shut down and spend the collateral before taking its place.

Being one of Network of Momentum’s Pillars means more than just holding a valid collateral. Pillars will be the first network participants to experience the Network of Momentum testnet, as well as having development voting rights once it is released. _Pillar nodes will have four times the weight of a regular node._

In order to ensure that every participant experiences a flawless lock-in phase, technical support will be increased on our social channels during the Pillar Lock-in phase.
