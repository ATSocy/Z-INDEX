1.  **Which will be top 3 most relevant features, partners, or functionalities we will see after Alphanet launch?**
    — The Network of Momentum Phase 0 represents the foundation to build a vibrant ecosystem on the long term. Among the most important features are decentralization at every level, the dual-coin and dual-ledger architecture, feeless transactions powered by a Plasma generation mechanism and native token transfers. Other important features are still in development and will be available after Alphanet launch.
2.  **Will we be able to mint NFTs on Zenon Network in the near future?**
    — Yes, NFTs are one area of major interest.
3.  **Are you going to publish a peer reviewed white/yellowpaper with the launch of the alphanet as promised?**
    — The most important thing right now is focusing on the Alphanet release and a smooth swap process. After that there is plenty of time for more in-depth research initiatives.
4.  **Please name 3 aspects that will carry Zenon into the top 10 amongst all crypto projects**
    — Commitment to decentralization, community support, long term vision & objectives
5.  **Will there be an NFT platform after Alphanet launches? If yes, can we list community’s projects? For how much?**
    — The community will have all the necessary resources and tools to develop a NFT platform after Alphanet launch.
6.  **When will the first strategic partners be announced and will it be in waves or all at once with the Big Bang**
    — Strategic partners will be able to join the ecosystem after #AlphanetBigBang.
7.  **Will genesis pillars be spawned before the end of incentivized testnet?**
    — The Legacy Pillars will have the opportunity to become Genesis Pillars before the end of the Public Incentivized Testnet.
8.  **As there are many other L1 options, how do you plan to attract devs to develop on NoM? Are you capable of affording big grants like some other projects do?**
    — Zenon Fabric.
9.  **When will SDK be released? Are there some demo zApps being built as inspiration? What programming languages will Alphanet support?
    **— Stay tuned for WarpDrive event.
10. **We have seen many times that user base is the most important thing that drives a crypto project to success. For example as seen on Solana, network effect is very valuable. We need pioneers(public figures) to make people adapt NoM. What are your plans on that regard?
    **— Use-cases will drive adoption better than anything else.
11. **Will smart contracts be part of Alphanet?
    **— Yes. Initially only the embedded smart contract layer will be available at Alphanet launch.
12. **Are sentries still going to be a thing? Will they be part of BTC interoperability during NoM phase 1?
    **— Sentries are planned for NoM Phase 1.
13. **Will Zenon bridge with other chains like Fantom, ETH, AVAX? similar to BSC Bridge?
    **— All EVM chains are compatible with the current Zenon Bridge implementation and can be extended to work two-way after Alphanet launch.
14. **Which SDKs already developed? Which ones under development?
    **— At the moment the Dart SDK is ready for production and it is currently powering the Syrius wallet.
15. **In light of both increasing crypto regulations in many parts of the world, and your commitment to true decentralization, especially maintaining anonymity, how can legacy companies possibly migrate to Web3 on the NoM if they are bound by law to have complete transparency with KYC?
    **— There are plenty of innovative identity solutions that can preserve privacy and still be compliant.
16. **Will the wallet be supported on mobile or just desktop?
    **— The wallet is developed on a framework that is natively cross-platform: desktop, mobile and web.
17. **Does bitcoin operability mean Zenon can do DEFI with native bitcoin?
    **— This is another area of interest.
18. **Many L1 popped up this cycle and made a great progress, how you intend to attract traction from the industry (builders, key players, etc) if everything under the radar for long time, marketing reach is low and difficulty of communication?
    **— Alphanet, Fabric, Accelerator.
19. **How will the governance of the network look in the next stages? How is the team planning on onboarding contributors to codebase?
    **— Initially only Pillars will be part of the governance process. All the code will be open-source, so anyone can join and start contributing right away.
20. **What is the plan regarding Satellite dedicated SDK for pillars?
    **— There are already some implementations currently available that can be extended and customized accordingly.
21. **When will cold wallet support be available?
    **— The implementation for cold wallet support is possible and can be developed after Alphanet launch.
22. **When and how will the original QSR snapshot be distributed?
    **— Users can already test and verify the QSR LockDrop distribution in the ongoing SwapDrop event. The same procedure will also be available after Alphanet launch.
23. **Can you give more details on how Taproot will be relevant for NoM? When you mentioned BTC interoperability, what is your vision for Zenon Network? Which functionalities can be done? — hope you answer elaborately on this one.
    **— Taproot (BIP-340, BIP-341, BIP-342) will unleash a new innovation wave for developers that will make possible Bitcoin use-cases that are simply not possible today. The objective is to identity those uses cases and capitalize on them.
24. **What’s been the most difficult part of building the Network of Momentum? What are the plans for interoperability between chains? Are there any new exchange listing in the pipeline?
    **— A strong foundational layer takes time to develop and the most challenging part were the architectural decisions.
25. **Since the authoring of the whitepaper and the lightpaper, have there been any significant additions to or deviations from the originally-intended network architecture of the NoM?
    **— Technology advances every day. The long term vision is the same, but the network must keep pace with tech advancements (e.g. adapt to new crypto-quantum resistant algorithms, etc.). _Adapt or die._
26. **What steps have you taken to ensure Zenon ZNN & QSR don’t run foul of the SEC, thereby ensuring inclusion on US based Crypto exchanges?
    **— ZNN & QSR are utility tokens powering the operation of NoM.
27. **Can you guys provide a staking guide that covers the basics for absolute beginners? Eg. can you close the program, turn your computer off, if WiFi interruption does it need reset? For legacy and for Alphanet thanks.
    **— Such information is covered for the Legacy Network. [https://zenon.network/legacy/howto](https://zenon.network/legacy/howto)
    We encourage the community to write more in-depth guides for the Alphanet.
28. **Why did you name Alphanet launch as Big Bang?.
    **— Every universe has its Big Bang moment.
29. **Is there a deadline for legacy pillars to convert to Alphanet pillars?
    **— Given the Swap Decay mechanism, Legacy Pillars should migrate to Alphanet during the first three months. [https://medium.com/p/658981a9d8bd](https://medium.com/p/658981a9d8bd)
30. **At Alphanet do Legacy Pillars/Nodes stop receiving rewards?
    **— Yes.
31. **Original Private Testnet participants were previously informed that massive throughput will be achieved in 2 stages of development: a planned upgrade after the Alphanet release, and another at NoM Phase 1. Can you share what these two planned upgrades entail?
    **— Currently the focus is on stability rather than scalability. After Alphanet launch, a massive throughput enhancement is to be expected.
32. **Once the Alphanet launches and code for NoM phase 0 is open sourced, are there plans for the Zenon team to formalize collaborative work with volunteers and other groups on the continued development of NoM?
    **— Everyone can participate and contribute to the codebase.
33. **Once the Swap Cycle begins from Legacy to Syrius, would the staking continue on legacy wallet?
    **— No
34. **Incentivized Program was launched, stating its for people who missed the LockDrop. But with the current average, most will end up with around 200 QSRs. Where as the ratio during the lock drop was 1:10 & 1:5. Surely its still a big miss for new joiners. Can we expect a revision?
    **— No
35. **Are we expecting better security on Syrius wallet, such as 2FA and Yubikey? Password alone isn’t very secure.
    **— If it’s a strong password it’s very secure due to the Argon2 KDF used. 2FA solutions can be layered on top to provide addional security such as OTP codes and hardware keys including Yubikeys.
36. **Can we expect a swap option for ZNN <\> QSR on Syrius after Alphanet is launched?
    **— Yes
37. **Staking for QSR on Syrius is stated as 24% APY, is it fixed, or are we expecting any revisions depending on the number of stakers?
    **— Staking depends on the following factors:
    • staking duration
    • amount staked
    • other active staking participants
38. **As mentioned earlier, there is no one winner. Who does Zenon see as its closest competition?
    **— Other L1 smart contract platforms that bring real innovation.
39. **Are there any incentivization to Community members who participated in the testnet by spawning Sentinels and Pillars?
    **— It’s being considered.
