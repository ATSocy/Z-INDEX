This nine-part article series aims to explain Zenon Network in a way which is simple, digestible and fun. Its premise is that education, learning and understanding are part of the formula for ecosystem growth and adoption for what some are already calling Satoshi’s Ethereum. Let’s get started!

Enter the rabbit-hole.

## In 1 Minute …

-   Zenon Network is a **new layer-1** crypto with a mainnet which went live in November of 2021. There are plans for Apps, NFTs as well as interoperability and DeFi with native Bitcoin
-   **True decentralisation**. Zenon closely adheres to the Bitcoin Ethos and its launch was egalitarian with no presale, premine, VCs or insider allocations. Same conditions for everyone via a public bond
-   **Unique tech**. Zenon innovates with a dual-ledger. A meta-DAG for the consensus and a block-lattice for storing transactions. It has two native coins to achieve equilibrium. There are plans to implement Narwhal and Tusk for extreme scalability. It is feeless\*
-   **Anon team**. The original core team are anonymous, and they have passed the torch to the community to stay in line with the Bitcoin Ethos. Is there speculation Zenon is backed by OG Bitcoiners? DYOR
-   Zenon | **ZNN** | **Governance** | 9M supply, 90M max supply
-   Quasar | **QSR** | **Gas\*** | 30M supply, 80M max supply

## In 5 Minutes …

-   Zenon is feeless on the layer-1 level. Users can do a simple proof of work calculation to send and receive transactions. For higher throughput, they can lock QSR for time to generate “plasma”, and QSR is not spent
-   There are devs building two Layer 2s right now. One is EVM compatible for the sake of interoperability; the other is cutting-edge tech for extreme scalability. The smart contracts will be hosted on these layer-2s to keep the base layer minimalist and efficient
-   Zenon’s principled adherence to decentralisation via its egalitarian launch and grassroots marketing has been essential to make the network owned and controlled by the people, not institutions
-   Zenon has ambitious plans for Bitcoin, partly by leveraging the Taproot upgrade which allows for new use-cases. Further down the road, there are plans for Zenon to integrate with Bitcoin via merged mining as the full realisation of Zenon’s whitepaper is a hybrid of PoS and PoW
-   To run a Sentinel you need 5k ZNN & 50k QSR, and to run a Pillar you need 15k ZNN & 150k+ QSR

## Parting Thoughts

Zenon is a complex project with a rich and nuanced history despite its young age, but it’s well-worth trying to understand it. Pumpable narratives, cute memes and bright casino lights — all of that is great. Going all-in because your favourite influencer is telling you he sees a bull flag if he squints a certain way — fantastic.

But Zenon is here to remind people that strong fundamentals and actual utility wins in the longrun. Zenon is a sovereign ecosystem, but its plans for DeFi with Bitcoin are a huge point of interest. Very simply, its major goal can be distilled to:

> **_BTC + ZNN \> BTC_**

Bitcoin needs scaling solutions as well as ways to increase its programmability so it can truly rival and replace tradfi. Or is it just a coincidence that Zenon’s mainnet went live a few days after the Taproot ugprade, and that Zenon’s founders signed the Taproot block 709632 with ASCII art?
