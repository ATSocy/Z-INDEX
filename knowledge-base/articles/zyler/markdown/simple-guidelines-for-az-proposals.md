From the discussions we’ve had so far about AZ submissions, I’d like to kickstart another chat about guidelines for Accelerator Z proposals covering trusting who is submitting and the price they are asking for.

^^ a pillar left by actual aliens to confound, inspire and awe the humans

## 1\. Who is this person, and why should we trust them submitting a proposal?

We’re all anonymous here, which has its pros and cons. One drawback is you don’t have that person’s resume or references, so you can’t see the quality of their prior work (if it even exists, there are scammers out there).

**SOLUTION:**

(i) Include a portfolio of your prior work; hopefully this is possible and verifiable. If not, consider providing a sample of work you have done so far for the proposal.

(ii) Some applicants will like to know that the pillars are at least interested in their proposal _before_ they do any work for it. One could argue: Well, how serious are you about your proposal if you’re not willing to even start it without approval? That may become the prevailing attitude amongst pillars when AZ becomes more competitive. For example, if three competing devs all applied at the same time to do the same SDK — you would choose the person who can provide a quality sample. (Possibly a bad example, as you could combine the best parts of each SDK for a master one).

(iii) Given the current lack of competition though, it’s reasonable to just gain approval from the pillars first even with no sample work done. They have signalled their interest, and no funds have been put at risk because you don’t earn anything until the first phase is complete. At that point you would have to provide evidence of what you’ve done so far, needs to be of a verifiable high quality and delivered on time etc. This is where the real voting occurs.

(iv) Note that not every project has to have multiple phases — it may even be ideal for some projects to have just the one phase. You submit your proposal, pillars signal interest. You then just go ahead and finish the entire job, then present it for inspection. Possible you’ve just wasted a lot of time and effort, but also possible that people appreciate your work and reward you for it. When it comes down to it, the pillars initially approving your proposal is a show of good faith, now you can get to the finish line with the understanding that delivering on your promises will be honoured with the release of funds agreed upon.

(v) Many projects will need multiple phases though, the funding is an integral part of getting it done. For these projects, just follow the same principle but for each of the phases — or even split the one project into multiple different proposals as suggested by the official medium article. This may also be good for projects that will take a long time; to mitigate the issue of price volatility by the time it comes to actually voting to release the funds.

## 2\. Are they asking for too much funding?

This is a contentious topic, as some seem to think that people should work for free and in their minds 1 ZNN = $1000 already which is just not fair to anyone as we could be at a flat price for months, nobody knows the future.

**SOLUTION**:

(i) Don’t ask anyone to work for free or push to devalue their work. You don’t know their financial situation, or what country they’re from. Not understanding the importance of money is a very privileged mindset to have, not everyone has that luxury. The grant program isn’t solely to provide funds that are necessary for the project — it’s also to reward contributors by allocating capital to people who are positive for the ecosystem.

(ii) Paying contributors in ZNN and QSR is problematic given the volatility of the coins. The only fair way is we go by the current market value converted into USD, but the issue with that is the price is massively crashed at the moment. Could just accept that early contributors will be overpaid, but as long as they add real value to the ecosystem it’s all good, and future contributors will be underpaid; this will balance out the problem. While annoying for future contributors, ultimately if they decide to go ahead with it, they have decided they are better off financially doing it vs not doing it. And in the same way, they themselves may be getting overpaid compared to grants that come in 10 years time — it’s a matter of perspective. Or do we decide on the fair market value of ZNN? Do we agree on $100?

(iii) Another way of thinking about it might be, so we have 900k ZNN in the fund. 150k ZNN is for hyperspace, lets allocate say 30k ZNN for the 8 SDKs. That’s 3k ZNN per SDK as a rough amount. Could allow the community to decide on approximate bounties for each of the things to be done?

(iv) Before formally submitting in SYRIUS, post everything on the forum first. Have a back and forth about the price you will do it for. Ideally both parties agree on the amount requested, proposal gets approved. Disagreement? You will likely find that the pillars will not approve the proposal/phase. Start high and negotiate down, and explain the time and energy investment needed as well as your skillset.

(v) Input from technical people is appreciated, as an average guy may be swindled into thinking a task is harder than it is which would warrant more funding than is needed. Do we need someone to explain technical things in a simple way such that non-technical people can have a good conceptual grasp of the tasks? Would be nice if this accompanied each proposal. Loved what George did in his article, I’d like to see more of that.

(vi) Also for the forum discussion; let’s try to be consistent with what we pay people for; but the price volatility of the fund will of course have an effect on this. Some will be unfairly overpaid or underpaid — unavoidable reality. Just how it is. But let’s try to minimise how unfair it is, and we can use existing approved projects as a reference for funding, so we essentially do a form of price discovery based on what has been approved in the past. Unless of course you argue there is a difference with your project, which is part of effecting lobbying. Again, this is just part of the game. In extreme cases, someone who has been unfairly negotiated down may want to do a re-submission in light of a comparable project getting way more— but this is taking a risk. They could open a discussion about that before doing so, or just get on with it.

(vii) When deciding cost, note that any time and energy investment constitutes work; but even that is misleading. Takes a week to build an SDK? But how long did it take them to learn their computer skills? The months or years behind their skillset must be taken into account which is why professionals have a higher hourly rate. Furthermore, many professionals in the one city? Another guy says he will do it for cheaper; game theory lowers their rate. But then, you get what you pay for? The cheaper guy may do a crappy job of it or just collect his phase 1 funds and abandon it. This is a complex issue, which is why it’s so essential to discuss our different viewpoints on the community forum and keep an open mind.

## 3\. Trouble Reaching the Quorum

Remember that lobbying is important. You ideally post the idea and detailed plan for phases all in the one post. And be around to answer valid questions and defend yourself and explore talking points.

**SOLUTION:**

(1) Feel free to use multiple mediums such as twitter and telegram, but the current consensus is **use the community forum** because it filters away spam and is an ideal platform to have an organised discussion which is easy to refer back to a week later (good luck doing that on telegram when everything gets lost in endless messages, no normal person has the time to read through every single one of them).

## Final Thoughts

I hope this article is re-posted onto the forum for feedback people might have, I’m mostly just thinking out loud here. I’m sure we all want to help streamline the process of people getting approved by the DAO and delivering for Zenon — something we can all agree on! Some quick links:

-   **Zenon Community Forum**, the place you should post an **informal submission** first to get feedback on your idea, your funding requested etc. Also check out existing threads in the accelerator Z section to learn about the process from other submissions
-   **Zenon.Network**, the official website where you can download the SYRIUS wallet (you make a **formal submission** via the wallet)
-   **Hyperspace X Accelerator Z: towards a DAO of DAOs**. The official medium article on hyperspace/accelerator Z.
-   **Web3 is dead. Long-live Accelerator Z**. A big-brained community member’s thoughts on Accelerator Z; worth a read by anyone. Also gives insight which is very valuable for a non-technical person, for example when he is discussing SDKs (amongst other things), done by George.
-   **Budgeting in 5d Hyperspace**. Some nice infographics and thoughts about price volatility and strategy for budgeting our AZ fund over time, done by Ztark. I’d like to see a longer version of this!

**Take care and WAGMI!**
