Here we are, the fifth and final article in the series: An investor’s thesis for Zenon. What follows is my own thesis, done in a non-traditional style. I am only sharing my thoughts — feel free to agree, disagree or disregard. This piece assumes you have read the earlier articles in the series, which are linked at the end. Let’s go!

**Disclaimer**: This article is not financial advice and may contain speculation.

**Extended Disclaimer**: As great as your thesis might be for an investment, it is ultimately still just a probability, and with something as important as your money you should protect against worst-case scenarios. Never put in money that you can’t afford to lose, and be aware that even if you believe Zenon will take off at some point — no one knows when. It could be in 6 months or in 6 years. Please be responsible and plan accordingly.

Two prominent ZNNAliens Buffet & Schiff; ZNN and QSR maxis respectively. They just don’t know it yet!

## What do you see?

Bitcoin blazed a path that shook the world and created crypto as we know it. From what we’ve seen, it is rarity to follow in its path. Why? It takes longer, it’s harder and not many have the morality or discipline to see it through. Why commit to something long, hard and right when you can do something short, fast and wrong? Produce vapourware, do a pre-sale, dump on retail then bail. But like Yoda says, the path to the dark side is faster yes, but not stronger.

**Enter Zenon,** an entity which embodies decentralisation at every level and mirrors the Bitcoin ethos. Furthermore, it seeks to be synergistic with Bitcoin.

It is a layer-1 network which is **feeless** and **fairly launched** which aims to:

**(1)** Solve the blockchain trilemma, in so doing creating a **new standard** for **Apps** and **NFTs** which will also inherit the NoM’s feeless feature

**(2)** Leverage the taproot upgrade to deliver feeless **defi with Bitcoin**.

**(3)** Speculative for now, but Zenon can integrate with and **improve the lightning network** by allowing for feeless transactions and decreasing the need to trust the watch towers

Henry David Thoreau once wrote: “It’s not what you look at, it’s what you see.” Looking at Zenon, I don’t see a remote resemblance to anything else in the crypto space. It’s totally alien. Definitely not an alt or sh\*tcoin. It’s like Bitcoin, but a separate entity and in its atomic era. It’s a mystery inside a riddle that’s been wrapped on the enigma blockchain. It’s a blind painter’s masterpiece. It’s the inevitable crash-landing of alien tech. What do you see?

## A tale of two devs

Professor Z founded Zenon, the core team continues it and over time they will either disappear or blend into the community as Zenon becomes a global, leaderless entity. Even still, the core team delivered our foundation — an entire layer 1 network from scratch, which is also feeless and decentralised. So you might be wondering, how skilled are they? Are they world-class talents? Can they be counted on to help bring about some of the huge ambitions we have, despite the serious innovation that will be required?

I think it comes down to this. Zenon’s discipline to follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps — mirroring its values and ethos — is going to attract the most talented devs in the world. Why would that be the case, and how will that impact our success?

**Let’s consider two examples:**

**Person A** comes into his web3 job at exactly 9am on a Monday. He’s hungover and depressed. He works for a VC whose main “company value” is to fleece retail investors, despite it being written only in their actions (the only thing that counts). He feels like a bad person for selling his soul to this sociopathic agenda, but at least it pays well. He clocks on, slogs through mediocre coding where he does the minimum to not get fired, at exactly 5pm he clocks off, f\*cks off, gets paid, gets laid and does it all again the next week.

**Person B** sometimes comes into his Zenon job an hour earlier just because he’s excited about the day! He woke up fresh and sharp; he’s happy with what he’s doing, so there’s no reason to self-medicate with drugs and alcohol every weekend. As a Bitcoiner, working for Zenon he works for an entity whose values align with his own and it’s the perfect outlet for him to do work that’s meaningful. He could earn more money elsewhere, but being a top-tier, super talented dev he’s already made a comfortable amount of money, and earning slightly more is less of a concern for him. With his basic needs met, he is blessed to be in a position where his life’s work is now the top priority. At that point, it’s the good you can do for others and what you’re leaving behind — it’s something that gets you going easily because you actually care a lot about it.

So which dev is going to bring more innovation, person A or B? Person B is probably more intelligent and creative, but there’s another crucial aspect to this. Galileo Galilei once wrote: “Passion is the genesis of genius.” To smash the status quo and deliver something the world has never seen, you simply need a fire burning within you. When your heart and mind align, only then are you primed to receive ideas, gifts, from the universe which come almost fully formed. Nikola Tesla believed that all information came from somewhere in the universe, and that his mind was just a receiver. He also fell in love with a pigeon … but ah, anyway. I can see it though. If you envision the flow of ideas and knowledge in the universe, I see trickles forking to web3 — but the bulk of the river goes direct to Zenon’s ecosystem.

## Regulations — you have no power here!

Probably, regulations are gonna nuke the current crypto landscape (if these defi ponzi schemes don’t nuke themselves first, looking at you LUNA 2.0).

**Like Bitcoin, Zenon will be resistant to these regulations.**

The two tokens which power the NoM are not useless and therefore unregistered securities, they actually have vital uses for the functioning of the NoM. **They are utility tokens**.

-   ZNN — for infrastructure and governance. A lot will be locked up in nodes and staking. Every pillar does not burn the ZNN, but because the QSR is burned that will incentivise them to run the pillar for a long time, which is a de facto long lockup time for the ZNN, lessening its liquidity. All of the governance decisions will be influenced by delegators shifting their weight of ZNN for the short-term and longterm benefits of the NoM …
-   QSR — for infrastructure and gas\*. A lot will be locked up in nodes. Every pillar burns an increasing amount of QSR. Transactions with high throughput or complexity require it which applies to all of the apps that will be built on the NoM. (\*QSR is not gas, but it generates ‘plasma’)

Both tokens have extreme utility, which should translate into extreme demand. Not many cryptos require their native tokens, but Zenon does. This may bode well for the price action of these tokens, as price is the intersection of supply and demand. And these coins are rather scarce …

Furthermore, centralised entities with known leaders can be regulated. But an anonymous team can’t be regulated. This is even more the case when said anonymous team morphs into a leaderless, global decentralised network, like Bitcoin itself. Once it reaches this ideal, Zenon will be fully safe from the regs.

**How is the passing of the torch to the community going?**

There’s multiple signs that the founders/core team are in the process of partially or fully disappearing. They may or may not return as regular community members, keen to contribute on a level playing field:

-   Zenon was launched via a public sale known as xStakes, among other strategies it put the coins in the hands of the people.
-   On the 21/3/2022, reportedly 1.2M lines of production code have been made over the course of 3 years; the rest will soon be fully open-sourced. A vital and inevitable step for security, longevity and open participation.
-   On the 23/4/2022, the fifth version of the SYRIUS wallet was fully open-sourced under permissive licensing, available on github.
-   There’s rumours of a new website coming, made by the community to replace the one ran by the core team. At least we assume they run it?
-   There’s rumours control of the official twitter account will be passed on to people from the community, replacing the core team’s control. At least we assume the core team currently runs it?
-   With the launch of Accelerator Z, the DAO can grant funding to anyone willing and able to contribute positive value to the ecosystem. Pillar holders and delegators can be anyone; Zenon walks the talk of decentralisation in all things including governance.

## Wen moon? Wen lambo?

If there’s so much potential and promise, why does numba only go down? The macro goes in cycles, relax. And most good crypto projects, there’s a lot of volatility within a range that then becomes a distant memory once a higher price floor is reached. A lot of graphs are flat, flat, flat — then a huge pump comes. Buy while it’s flat, and wait for the pump. Just have the mental strength and emotional resilience to make it to that point. The pipe dream for many ZNNAliens is to run a node and have a separate bag which they will partially dump to dramatically change their lives — hopefully for the better. Hopefully to liberate them so they can work on what they choose to without financial pressure. Zenon is a tough HODL, for sure. But as early participants, the larger risk we take on has a potentially larger reward too. For the cultists, even if it went to $1 or 10 cents — that’s a buy. It may hurt you unbelievably to see your portfolio’s value crushed as such, especially if you over-invested by, like, a lot — but to a believer the pain is just a discount sale. As the adage goes, _fortunes are made in the bear market_.

**Here are the milestones I believe we are going to hit:**

First, **we need to get a working product**. While so much has been achieved already, there’s still a lot to be done this year. In December 2022, sentinels should play an active role which will help scalability, then we can finally get an idea of our max TPS (it’s theoretically 100k). Many things can be mentioned, but BTC interoperability, smart contracts, a mobile wallet with an embedded node and some vested pillars for strategic partnerships — the end of 2022/start of 2023 could well bring a higher price floor despite the macro. Regardless of the speculative premium, we need the developments to reach a critical mass where it can then be said that we have a working product, which also means the project will need to be entirely open-sourced for the sake of security and truly passing the torch to the community to carry it.

Second, **we need adoption**. Once we have something that’s basically working and improving every day, we will need partnerships and people to actually use it. There’s funding set aside for marketing to increase awareness which will pump the number of investors and devs. There’s also funding for partnerships which will open doors by providing mutually beneficial opportunities. When we have feeless defi with Bitcoin, apps and NFTs all actually being used — the price will reflect the adage that despite the narratives and hype; utility wins in the longrun.

Third, **there’s speculation**. Investors with a longterm mindset have an interesting proposition in front of them. If they believe in the power of the blockchain to transform the world, they will see incredible potential in the NoM. The **NFT industry** is expected to become enormous, and as it branches into real-world assets, well, most of the real world is non-fungible. Zenon can capture a huge chunk of that economic activity, especially with the power of NFTs on Zenon which are feeless and secure. **Apps** for a whole variety of reasons … just one example, gamefi. People are increasingly spending their time gaming, so why not allow them to monetise their time? I personally see gaming and gambling as problematic when combined, as by themselves they can already be addictive, especially to a young person’s brain. But the reality is, things are moving this way, and Zenon can capture a chunk of that growing market as well. And of course, **defi with Bitcoin**, at its simplest level allowing people to send their Bitcoin to each other _feelessly_ through a secure and decentralised protocol. The full realisation of Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision, as outlined in the original whitepaper, would be a dream come true. People who believe in Bitcoin and its growing global dominance will realise that Zenon can capture some of that value and grow with it.

## I fell slowly, then all at once

Bitcoin is the most sound and hard money we have ever had. And while fiat is backed by militaries, entities with a monopoly on violence, Bitcoin does things differently. Its deflationary nature will disincentivize excessive world conflicts, and in so doing help bring about a better world. And as for environmental concerns, Bitcoin’s growing energy requirements will accelerate the transition to a future of abundant renewable energy. There’s also the personal freedom and empowerment Bitcoin brings to the unbanked which attracts libertarians to Bitcoin.

While many arrive at Bitcoin for the day-trading or the tech, it’s not the reason they stay. There’s this altruistic element to Bitcoin, hidden at first, but it speaks to people’s hearts. If Zenon is as intimately related and linked to Bitcoin’s ethos and mission as many believe it is, it’s of the utmost importance that we all do what we can to help in its crucial early stages and beyond. While not everyone gets to be a recognisable superhero who saves the day, there’s still the knowledge that you did what you could, and every bit helps the cause which is a damn good one.

Through bull, through bear, through anything — the Network of Momentum cannot be stopped. What is decentralised can never die, and what is loved will reach heights others can only dream of. See you guys when we fly past the moon and land on Mars!

Here’s the song I’ll be playing when the day comes:
