I can't seem to upload directly... based on file size. Seems to be an error, given that the max size is 100mb and these files are only 12mb.

Font and colorscheme suggestions from @Stark

> Presicav is one of, if not 'the most' commonly used font for Zenon. It's a very solid font across cases, characters, and bold and italics. I propose to stay consistent with Zenon and utilize Presicav. This also makes it simple.

I like the term BetaNet that @Stark used in the infographics thread.

From search AI

" Beta testing

Beta testing is a software testing method used in product development to evaluate the quality of a product with real users in real environments. It is the development stage after alpha testing, where a beta version of the software is evaluated by real users who provide feedback to improve the product before its release to the general public."

That's pretty much we are going for. Real users in real environments. But not for the general public on mainnet.

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-10-18 16:16:16 UTC | #21

The aforementioned Betanet concept:

https://forum.hypercore.one/t/how-to-implement-znn-qsr-on-hyperion/529?u=stark

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 16:26:55 UTC | #22

I think we should also clearly distinguish between 
HyperQube and hyperqube_z

HyperQube will be an ecosystem of extension chains

hyperqube_z is a specific extension chain serving as a betanet

One good question that Stark had was "When do things deserve their own names?" such as the Hyperion he suggested?

Does a betanet need one?

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-10-18 16:39:12 UTC | #23

Maybe we could ditch the Hyperxxxxx terms and roll with:

Zenon Alphanet
Zenon Betanet

I am a very creative person but in reality self-descriptive branding is a best practice. And we want to concentrate on reinforcing "ZENON" 

Zenon is already a great brand. There may be no need to invent another one.

It would be easy to just say "it's live on the betanet" - you can bridge to "the betanet", "it was tested on Betanet" - and it would be a lot easier for anyone to understand what that means without saying "well, it's like Kusama, have you heard of Kusama? It's thing other chain related to Po... 💀". 

"Betanet" saves a lot of energy from perpetual branding and marketing and educating, because it's name says what it is.

And it is immediately clear that Betanet emissions exist for Betanet utility.

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 16:57:36 UTC | #24

hyperqube_z will be A betanet, but not necessarily THE betanet
The HC1 incubator will also be a product, on a specific chain

i do think from a marketing perspective, "launching hyperqubes" is more memetic than "launching zenon extension chains", even if they mean the same thing

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 16:49:53 UTC | #25

i agree we need to focus on the Zenon Brand as the underlying ecosystem
But we shouldn't go against the natural force of language to create names for things that need them for communication efficiency
Especially out of fear

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 16:53:59 UTC | #26

iirc, you are a fan of Ordinals
Would it be smart to drop the name Ordinals and talk about them using the phrase "Bitcoin segwit data NFTs"?

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 17:11:22 UTC | #27

**Zenon Network**: Efficient and feeless L1 with Bitcoin ethos

**HyperQube**: Community Driven. L2 Extension Chains. [for] Zenon the Network of Momentum.
(that's what is on the https://www.hyperqube.network/ website right now)

**hyperqube_z**: HyperCore One's flagship extension chain. AZ incubator for collaborative development. Betanet features for rapid development.

I think it is fairly straightforward. The branding just needs to clearly communicate these relationships.

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 17:54:32 UTC | #34

So early on my thought was:

hyperqube_z: Zenon based betanet
hyperqube_s: Solana based extension chain
hyperqube_b: Bitcoin/elements based extension chain

aliencoder suggested supernova under hyperqube as 
hyperqube_nova

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-10-18 17:57:28 UTC | #35

BetaNet HyperQube
Supernova HyperQube
Solanom HyperQube

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 17:58:15 UTC | #36

that's even more names to keep track of :joy:

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 18:03:06 UTC | #37

HyperQube is the ecosystem, the framework, the tooling stack

hyperqube_\<something\> are just codes to refer to specific chains within the ecosystem.
It was purposely done that way to de-emphasize any chain in particular. It's an ID.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-10-18 18:03:49 UTC | #38

Goerli Testnet
[name = random] [purpose = test stuff]

Supernova HyperQube
[name = random] [purpose = enhance Zenon]

long term we'll probably drop the lastname, nobody says testnet for goerli

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 18:04:00 UTC | #39

In the future maybe, if extension chains really take off, maybe they'll just have numbers

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 18:05:03 UTC | #40

I need a branding package for HyperQube.
I don't need a chain specific one for hyperqube_z.

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-10-18 18:06:34 UTC | #41

I assume ordinals weren't called Biitcoin NFTs because of the technicality. If not for the technical difference, yes the self descriptive term "Bitcoin NFT" would be smarter. That's what everyone calls them when they first learn about them anyway.

You said it was a Betanet so I suggested calling it Zenon Betanet. 

You don't like the idea and you want to call it hyperqube_z but perhaps describe it as a betamet - while the ecosystem of extension chains is called HyperQube. That seems confusing to me but it's not my baby, nor my decision.

I only engaged in contributing to branding because it seemed like you wanted contributions. I have no need for my ideas to stand. Although I hope that in some cases, iterations in the process are valued.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-10-18 18:07:33 UTC | #42

I agree the brand is HyperQube, maybe it should be in front.

we can do hyperqube_betanet if we want more geek style but I dont think 1 character is the way xD

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 18:08:33 UTC | #43

hyperqube_z is my engineering id for it. The most efficient way for me to indicate the chain.

If the community calls it the Zenon Betanet that is fine.
But I've given my reason that it should not be considered THE zenon betanet.
It will be the betanet being used by HC1, a subset of the developer community.

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 18:10:14 UTC | #44

my point is that the term Ordinal still has been a useful one
and I think the Ordinal brand has brought more attention to bitcoin than taken away

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 18:12:45 UTC | #45

We are just discussing.
I think it is good to keep HyperQube as a name for a framework of extension chains.
If there is disagreement there, let's keep discussing.

I am not suggesting your ideas are bad or don't add value.

Stark | 2024-10-18 18:16:25 UTC | #47

I'm certainly not arguing that we can't make up brands. Most brands are totally made up words. Zenon is an example.

Fwiw, when you fascetiously say, "Would it be smart to... (call it segwit...)" the backside of that is."This is dumb."

😂 don't worry I'm getting used to it.

I honestly don't care about the branding decision. I easily take direction. But it's a little frustrating when I feel like I'm being encouraged to contribute, do a bunch of work, and then find out that the direction I was going was always going to be a dead end. ...and get called dumb. 😂😂😂 

I will correct course.

-------------------------

coinselor | 2024-10-18 18:16:53 UTC | #48

I created a [HyperQube chat](https://forum.hypercore.one/chat/c/hyperqube/47) :sweat_smile:

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 18:20:25 UTC | #49

I don't think I meant it like that...
I think you are taking the emotions from a previous discussion into this one.

I literally meant: "Do you think it would be a good marketing decision by Casey/ the creators of Ordinals to drop the Ordinals name entirely?"

If you think the answer is yes, I don't think you are dumb.

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-10-18 18:22:24 UTC | #50

No worries I know I'm sensitive. I'm laughing at myself.

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 18:32:07 UTC | #51

Just evaluating the context of Ordinals,
Maybe now, one could argue that it is obvious to just call them bitcoin NFTs.

But during launch, they likely didn't know how popular it would be and end up being the de facto standard. The branding of Ordinals was something fresh and probably got more attention than if they had just called themselves Bitcoin NFTs, which had been done before e.g Colored coins with less degrees of success. The name was something to rally behind, and it pushed bitcoin to new directions.

In the future if we are successful, we can hope people will say "hyperqube? it's just zenon extension chains" But until that point, I do think having a HyperQube brand will be useful. Would we have the engagement so far if I had just said, join the "hypercore one extension chain effort"? I'm not sure.

If people disagree, let's keep discussing.

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 18:33:04 UTC | #52

hmmm, maybe there's something to this...

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-10-18 18:40:26 UTC | #53

Ideally, these are all backend terms that only devs and ops utilize. The more likely a user is to ever utter or need to understand what hyperqube / betanet / hyperion / extension chain are, the more ogre the ux.

I feel like I'm coming back around full circle when I thought not to create branding for supernova.

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 18:48:17 UTC | #54

Agree. Just like how using Lightning Network should feel like any other bitcoin transaction. Is it there yet? idk. but that's the goal.

The initial users of the hyperqube extension chains will be builders and contributors. That's why the incubator is the first feature planned for it.
But even if the target audience is just contributors, devs, ops, we still need branding oriented towards them.

The messaging I've suggested does not focus on any new asset or new chain in particular. Rather I suggest it focus on the the collaborative processes we are building out, the ability for more people to get paid and thus involved, and a future tech stack that will let others spin up their own chains.

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 18:59:45 UTC | #55

Maybe we drop the logo and just use a word mark?

HyperQube
Zenon Network Extension Chains

hyperqube_hc1_betanet as an unbranded chain ID?

Stark has already done most of the work regarding fonts, colorschemes etc.
Maybe we get the wordmark as an svg in the cool font, bundle it into a pdf deliverable + downloadable assets and move on?

@sugoibtc what do you think? As candidate for awareness lead?

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 19:07:11 UTC | #56

or maybe ZNN^3 as a logo, like what @coinselor had

ZNN³
znn³

-------------------------

sugoibtc | 2024-10-18 20:25:49 UTC | #57

Ok, just read up on the discussion. I think it's doable. 

So TL;DR:
- HyperQube == Extension chain ecosystem on NoM 
- They are divided into Betanets (e.g. Hyperqube_z, Hyperqube_nova etc.)

But how would we call mainnet extension chains? Would that mean that every extension chain could potentially have a Hyperqube variant to test stuff on? 

The only thing I don't really like is it being called "betanets", but if that's common dev-jargon it's fine I guess...

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-18 21:22:14 UTC | #58

not exactly
hyperqube_hc1_betanet would be one of the extension chains
hyperqube_\<another name\> would be another production extension chain

for example maybe @build_republic would launch a hyperqube_build_republic chain. which wouldn't be a betanet

most of the extension chains will not be betanets
betanet is just a term we are using to say production network with some test features

maybe instead of 3, it's 3+1 (for the hyperqube instead of just cube) ?

eh maybe just 3 is better
i think i like the lowercase znn better too, since there's an offset at the top with the superscript

I need to create a disclaimer about payouts that we can reuse.

Hi guys, I started outlining the acceptance criteria for the Branding Kit on the HQ Wiki [here](https://zenon.wiki/index.php/HC1:_HyperQube_SIG_WP1/HyperQube_Branding).

Let me know if there's anything missing or if there are any other remarks, so I can adjust accordingly.

In terms of an executive decision regarding logo/word mark:

Do you agree we should go with the 3 qube design from @Stark 
and a wordmark such 

ZENON (large font)
---------line-----------
hyperqube.network (small font)

this puts the zenon brand front and center
and provides a url that people can learn more about hyperqube and how it relates to Zenon

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-11-04 12:22:22 UTC | #69

Thank you for organizing this.

I will nominate @Stark to complete the work that he has already started here. The median incentives signaled by the pillars for round 1:

Branding
2000 / 80250 Points
374 / 15k ZNN
3738 / 150k QSR

**Disclaimer** : The payment amounts provided herein are intended as guidelines only and do not constitute a binding offer or guarantee of payment. The HyperQube Incubator framework works with Zenon Network Pillars to signal incentives which are subject to change over multiple rounds. Actual payment amounts will be based on Accelerator-Z grants that depend on the voting rules and requirement of Accelerator-Z.

@Stark do you accept?
