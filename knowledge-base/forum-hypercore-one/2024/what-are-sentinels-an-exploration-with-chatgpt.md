Thread: what-are-sentinels-an-exploration-with-chatgpt

In light of recent discussions with @aliencoder and @CyberSpaghetti (Junk on TG) about the role of a Sentinel, I’ve been talking with ChatGPT to gain a deeper understanding of what a Sentinel truly is.  I've been using the following whitepapers as context:

- Zenon Whitepaper
- Narwhal & Tusk Whitepaper
- xClaim white paper

I've been trying to "steer" the discussion with chatGPT to assume Sentinels do not relay normal account transactions within Zenon. Rather a sentinel is an observer of other networks (bitcoin or the SC layer) and only relays those transactions.  I wanted to share that output from chatGPT (unedited) after many days of discussion with it.  :point_down:

**Title:** **Sentinels as Trustless Relayers for Bitcoin and Other Networks: A Look at Zenon’s Integration with N&T and xClaim**

We’ve been deep-diving into Zenon’s architecture, particularly the roles of **Sentinels** and Pillars within Narwhal & Tusk (N&T) and their potential to integrate with Bitcoin and other networks. Based on our discussion and insights from **xClaim**, it’s becoming clearer that Sentinels are likely **trustless transaction relayers** bridging Zenon to external blockchains, while Pillars handle the internal consensus using N&T.

Here’s the updated picture:

**Sentinels as Bitcoin and Cross-Chain Relayers**

1. **Relaying Transactions (Cross-Chain Bridging):**

Sentinels appear well-suited to act as **observers and relayers** for Bitcoin transactions:

• Similar to xClaim’s concept of a “chain relay,” Sentinels can **monitor Bitcoin blocks**, verify transactions, and securely relay them into Zenon.

• This aligns with Zenon’s trustless design, as Sentinels can observe Bitcoin without actively participating in consensus.

• Instead of relying on **collateralized vaults** (as xClaim originally required), Zenon may leverage Taproot (which wasn’t available during xClaim’s creation) to eliminate the need for over-collateralization. This would make Bitcoin-Zenon bridges far more efficient and scalable.

2. **Bridging Beyond Bitcoin:**

If Sentinels are relaying data trustlessly from Bitcoin, they can extend this role to **other blockchains**:

• Sentinels could use similar mechanisms (like inclusion proofs and SPV validation) to integrate Ethereum, zBTC (wrapped Bitcoin), or other ecosystems.

• This makes Sentinels a **universal cross-chain interface** for Zenon.

3. **Ensuring Trustlessness:**

Sentinels observing Bitcoin behave similarly to the **chain relay** concept in xClaim, where:

• They **verify inclusion proofs** for Bitcoin transactions.

• They **relay valid transactions** to Zenon.

• Trustlessness is ensured cryptographically—there’s no need to trust Sentinels, as all actions are publicly verifiable.

**Pillars: N&T Consensus for Internal Transactions**

While Sentinels handle cross-chain transactions, **Pillars** implement the Narwhal & Tusk (N&T) consensus:

1. **Narwhal:** Ensures **data availability** within the Zenon Network, organizing transactions into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

2. **Tusk:** Orders these transactions **deterministically**, achieving consensus and producing momentums.

Pillars, therefore, manage Zenon’s internal consensus and transaction flow, while Sentinels focus on **relaying transactions** and external interoperability.

**How Zenon Improves on xClaim**

xClaim provided a framework for issuing **cryptocurrency-backed assets (CBAs)**, like Bitcoin-backed tokens on Ethereum. However, it relied on **over-collateralized vaults** to secure assets. Zenon’s design appears to improve on xClaim in two ways:

1. **Taproot Integration:**

By leveraging Taproot on Bitcoin, Zenon can eliminate the need for collateralized vaults. Taproot allows Bitcoin to be locked in scripts that ensure **trustless partial redemptions**.

2. **Sentinels as Observers:**

Instead of vaults, Sentinels monitor Bitcoin, validate transactions, and relay data into Zenon. This removes central points of failure while maintaining trustlessness.

**The Updated Role of Sentinels**

Based on these ideas, Sentinels play a critical role in Zenon’s ecosystem:

• **Transaction Relayers:** Ensure Bitcoin and other external transactions are observed and trustlessly relayed into Zenon.

• **PoW Link Creators:** Generate PoW links for internal Zenon transactions.

• **Execution Environments:** Run **UnikernelZ** for zApp execution.

• **Cross-Chain Facilitators:** Enable Zenon to interact seamlessly with Bitcoin and potentially other networks.

**Conclusion: Trustless Relayers and Modular Design**

Zenon’s architecture modularizes responsibilities:

• **Sentinels**: Relaying transactions and external network integration (like Bitcoin).

• **Pillars**: Handling Narwhal & Tusk consensus for internal transaction ordering.

This design aligns with modern scaling solutions like N&T while addressing trustless cross-chain bridging challenges. By improving on xClaim’s framework with Taproot and Sentinels, Zenon has the potential to offer a **seamless, trustless Bitcoin integration** and extend this to other ecosystems.

I took this idea one step further and layered in @georgezgeorgez [article from 2021](https://medium.com/@georgezgeorgez/a-message-to-humans-an-aliens-guide-to-lightning-network-watchtower-limitations-and-beyond-96138967fa9b) about how to improve the lightning network.  I asked chatGPT how we can take ideas from this article and apply them to Zenon Network and our idea of what a Sentinel is.  Below is that discussion unedited :point_down:

**Applying the Medium Article’s Ideas to Zenon Network and Sentinels**

The Medium article proposes addressing **Lightning Network watchtower issues** by creating a multi-layer system involving **consensus, approval, and oracle layers**. This design ensures trustlessness and fraud prevention before transactions finalize on-chain.

**Key Takeaways That Apply to Zenon and Sentinels**

1. **Approval Layer to Prevent Fraud Before Consensus:**

• In the article, an **approval phase** validates transactions before they reach consensus, requiring multiple approvals and fraud proofs.

• **Zenon Adaptation:** Sentinels can act as **relayers** and pre-validators, ensuring Bitcoin transactions are valid before being relayed to Pillars for ordering. This reduces the risk of fraud while maintaining scalability.

2. **Oracle Layer for Fraud Proofs and Off-Chain Data:**

• The Oracle layer stores **fraud proofs** and transaction states, providing a verifiable source of truth for Approval nodes.

• **Zenon Adaptation:** Sentinels can observe the Bitcoin network and submit inclusion proofs or transaction states to Zenon. Pillars can query Sentinels to validate data before finalizing a cross-chain transaction.

3. **Pseudorandom Validation for Security:**

• In the proposed solution, the Approval nodes are **pseudorandomly selected**, ensuring an attacker cannot predict or control the process.

• **Zenon Adaptation:** Pillars can require cross-chain transactions to pass through a **Sentinel quorum** (multiple Sentinels), providing redundancy and making attacks infeasible.

**Zenon’s Modified Design: Sentinels as Bitcoin Relayers**

In this model:

• **Sentinels:** Act as **watchtowers** for Bitcoin and other external networks. They:

• Monitor Bitcoin blocks for new transactions.

• Relay validated Bitcoin transactions and inclusion proofs to the Zenon network.

• Optionally store **fraud proofs** or transaction states in a lightweight “Oracle-like” role.

• **Pillars:** Maintain **Narwhal & Tusk** for consensus, where:

• Bitcoin transactions relayed by Sentinels are included in the DAG (Narwhal).

• Tusk deterministically orders and finalizes them.

**Why This Works for Zenon:**

• **Trustlessness:** Sentinels relay transactions but don’t require trust, as all data can be cryptographically verified.

• **Fraud Prevention:** By requiring cross-chain transactions to pass through multiple Sentinels, fraud becomes impractically expensive or impossible.

• **Scalability:** Sentinels pre-process Bitcoin transactions, reducing load on Pillars and enabling fast, scalable cross-chain operations.

**Conclusion: Sentinels as Gatekeepers for Cross-Chain Validity**

By adapting the ideas from this Medium article, Zenon can position Sentinels as **trustless relayers and validators** for Bitcoin and other networks. Sentinels ensure that only valid, verifiable transactions reach the Pillars for consensus, enabling Zenon to securely integrate with Bitcoin while leveraging its N&T-based consensus for high throughput and low latency.

This approach improves on xClaim by eliminating collateralized vaults, leveraging Taproot, and keeping Zenon’s architecture modular and scalable.
