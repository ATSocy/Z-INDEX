Thread: az-investment-thesis-position-paper
0x3639 | 2024-01-07 22:52:57 UTC | #1

In light of some [recent discussions](https://forum.zenon.org/t/zenon-storybook-az/1745/41?u=0x3639) on the .org forum I want to gauge the communities temperature on the mandatory use of funnels and attribution links through .org when applying for marketing AZs.

## AZ Purpose:

1) Write an investment thesis position paper on NoM similar to what Multichain Capital wrote about [THORChain](https://assets.ctfassets.net/qtbqvna1l0yq/5WqbfijNKHtIuEX4a8siDA/d3dd5ea7ca8959e59618405f6a2dce38/THORChain_Analysis_date.pdf).  The length of the paper will be +/- 10 pages and will be written in the same quality as the example paper.  EDIT: I'm willing change the content per this [suggestion below](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/az-investment-thesis-position-paper/301/71?u=0x3639). 

2) The paper will NOT have any links to funnels, attribution links, conversions or any professional marketing tools.  It will be posted on the /zenon-netwok repo and any website that will host it. 

I am proposing this structure to understand the communities feelings on demanding professional funnels, link attribution and value creation on all marketing AZs.

### Voting Criteria 
- If you vote YES on this AZ you are telling the community funnels, link attribution, and measured value creation are NOT required on all marketing AZ.  This will set the tone for future AZs.

- If you vote NO on this AZ you are telling the community  funnels, link attribution, and measured value creation ARE required for all marketing AZ.  This will set the tone for future AZs.

## Funding Request

1,000 ZNN.  I expect this to take 40 hours at $50 USD per Hour.  40 x $50 = $2,000 USD / $2.00 = 1,000 ZNN

I'm not sure when I can do this work and I hope someone from the community will collaborate with me.  

## Community Voting

In addition to pillar voting, I'm asking the community to anon vote below.  Your opinion matters and will help other marketers understand the requirements for future marketing AZs.    

UPDATE: I would like to add "Value Creation" in the vote list but I'm past the time cut off.  It should read "Funnels, Link Attribution and/or Measured Value Creation"

[poll type=regular results=always public=false chartType=bar]
* Funnels and Link Attribution ARE required on Marketing AZs
* Funnels and Link Attribution are NOT required on Marketing AZs
[/poll]

If the static funnels weren't branded as .org, would you include them to measure some metrics and offer paths of nurturing/conversions? They'd simply be hosted by .org but have no backlinks to the brand. The funnels would automatically set the referral in readers browsers, and can be tuned to offer your readers a path to conversion.

Would you collaborate?

[/quote]

Clearly we should be trying to figure out what marketing efforts are "working".  So where ever this gets hosted, I hope we can track views and clicks.  So yes I'm more than willing to collaborate. 

My goal with this AZ is to understand where the community stands on a strict adherence to professional marketing tools on every AZ.  I'm proposing that we do some FAFO marketing to see what works.  However, I don't want to waste funds to find out random stuff.  Or to find out if my random thoughts on NoM are interesting to people.

I'm proposing an investment theses that can be shared and posted anywhere.  Anyone who posts it can use any tool they want to track clicks, etc..  Or, they can simply not track clicks at all.  If the community and Pillars demand precision on marketing efforts, then we know what to expect for future AZz.

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-07 21:09:07 UTC | #4

Why are you limiting the measure of value to funnels and link attribution? There are many other ways to track and prove value. 

Value must be proven in exchange for obtaining community funds. The way how it is proven is secondary.

I'm proposing no value tracking, link tracking, or funnel tracking.  Simply produce high quality work we think will be useful.  But we cannot determine its usefulness today or upon submitting the AZ.

Do some marketing without having a way to determine if it results in buying $ZNN or clicking download on syrius.  But it's a useful piece of work that could generate a positive outcome for NoM.  

For example Twitter Gamez.  I have no idea how many people bought ZNN or downloaded syrius.  But we could see that Zenon was trending with twitter trending analytics as a result of this campaigns.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-01-07 21:16:22 UTC | #12

because not everyone can do that.  Or has the time to do that.  Or even wants to do that.  But that does not mean then cannot produce useful work.  I'm sure there are people here who are afraid to submit any marketing AZ for fear of getting push back on the funnel and value creation.  

we don't track the value created by every piece of code written.

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-07 21:16:53 UTC | #13

In that case I'd say the grantee should be able to show how previous, representative work he or she delivered was able to provably drive value. Else there's no precedent and basis to ask for funding.

Would you pay me to do a surgery if you didn't know I was a qualified surgeon? It's a basic comparison but you get what I mean.

They can if they collaborated on funnels they'd think would be useful for their strategy. This comes back to my point in my post on .org forums: people don't want to just because.

How about the rest of the influences in the market? Maybe PA had something to do with the trends too? I love attribution, but proven please.

-------------------------

my AZ does not consider that, so please vote accordingly.

The AZ will get paid out if the quality of the work is consistent with the AZ: institutional quality consistent with the sample

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-01-07 21:19:51 UTC | #19

that is why we are going to test again.  when the marketing is quiet.  More samples.

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-07 21:24:40 UTC | #20

Instead of measuring trends (which are hard to prove), why not put efforts to measure results conversions which Attribute offers. The logic is flawed: Putting efforts towards strategies where its metrics don't quite tell you if things work.

-------------------------

tapwoot | 2024-01-07 21:26:10 UTC | #21

Im happy to vote yes to whoever wants to contribute at the moment as contributors with talent are a rare breed in this diluted market. 

I understand the importance of tracking for an organisation who want to reward salesmen and that can continue under the zenon org brand. I also understand the importance of those who feel this is a decentralised experiment project and we are not one big corporate that has to track all leads to plot income flows and try to dissect the reasoning behind aping from links.

Just let it be, we need more work not more politics

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-07 21:45:41 UTC | #22

This is what you're offering in this proposal;:

1) Content.
2) No plan for a distribution strategy.
3) No plan for a nurturing plan post consumption.
4) No plan for a conversion plan during consumption.
5) No execution plan/timeline. Showing no evidence of qualification. Rather appearing like you only want to secure votes for the idea when not even ready to execute atm.

Will vote no 5 times. It's missing many of the [principles](https://forum.zenon.org/t/performance-marketing-proposal-guidelines/918) I suggested a long time ago.

So white label funnels will be zenon org brand? Answer that.

-------------------------

tapwoot | 2024-01-07 21:32:12 UTC | #24

First you’re going to explain to me what a white label funnel is to me

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-07 21:32:44 UTC | #25

Why are you participating in marketing discussions if you don't understand what white label means in a context of funnels? Yet alone criticize my brand.

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-07 21:48:09 UTC | #26

How do you measure whether it meets the standards if there's no frame of reference which neither the author or those voting on the payout have set? 

You can buy a fake rolex on the streets of bangkok and you or any non-expert won't be able to tell the difference. 

It will still be worth only 50 bucks sir

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-07 21:34:14 UTC | #27

White label in context of funnels:

1) The static funnel is assigned a network's brand domain i.e. zenon.info
2) There are no images, links relating to zenon.org
3) The whole appears as owned, created and hosted by zenon.info for this example.

-------------------------

tapwoot | 2024-01-07 21:35:05 UTC | #28

Because i have a vote sir

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-07 21:45:10 UTC | #29

Unqualified voters should be deterred from diluting our bags by wasting community funds on "contributions" that don't create any measurable value. 

Running a pillar and managing the treasury for the entire community doesn't liberate you from doing basic due diligence just because this is an open source project. On the contrary. You have a responsibility not to misappropriate funds. 

Of course you can choose to be irresponsible but then don't be surprised if people call you out for it.

-------------------------

tapwoot | 2024-01-07 21:50:24 UTC | #30

Delusional lol where does one get a qualification for having a pillar? 

You are very condescending with me. This isnt the first time. I feel its all because you’re jealous, its okay I forgive you buddy.

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-07 22:01:47 UTC | #31

Having a pillar doesn't mean you're qualified (albeit entitled) to vote on any matter. 

You (and others) have a precedent in approving funds for bogus submissions: https://zenon.tools/accelerator/ccb6c92b4de1b8b225013ff2102157bc6e20f04b5f68beab3dc67d7b4b592245#phases

Recent events did not exactly instill confidence that you learned your lesson.

The worst thing about this public debate is that the willingness for selective dilettantism taints the overall perception of this project and undermines the efforts of those who actually build value. By those who don't or refuse to understand it.

-------------------------

Chadass | 2024-01-07 22:03:55 UTC | #32

While I agree with some points it's not up to you or mehowz or anyone to dictate how ab A.Z proposal should be formated. Stay agile and don't blindly gatekeep. I feel like some Pillars imagine because they hold a stake in a microcap project they're suddenly overqualified. You don't dictate anything.

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-07 22:04:23 UTC | #33

This is what I don't get about this community:

When I know I'm not an expert in something, I hire talent. I hired my dev, infra engineering, analytics expert to tune the server-side ops.

Some others in the community: "I'm an infra engineer or dev, but today I decide to put on a marketing hat. Now pay me full value for my time, even though I have never successfully developed a full cycle marketing campaign which proved to work. I don't want to hire someone to come up with the right strategy/mix, I want to get paid for it. I don't think we need to prove if it works, it's valuable, trust me. I think it's useful cause other brands did it when they paid successful analysts to develop docs. I'm them too now."

This community is getting ridiculous.

-------------------------

Chadass | 2024-01-07 22:06:38 UTC | #35

On another note your personal ward are nefarious for the entire project. Respectfully. It goes for all of you. Mehowz wanting to enforce his data driven approach, deeznuts his company ways to do things, others .. well. You know. We are all different with different backgrounds and this should be a strength. Don't dilute it because you think you're better.

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-07 22:07:51 UTC | #36

At the end of the day what happens will happen and decisions are made by abiding to the rules of the protocol. But it's anyone's right and obligation to speak up if there's a risk of additional dilution because grants are approved with zero reason or diligence.

-------------------------

Chadass | 2024-01-07 22:08:04 UTC | #37

You re very vocal mehowz but in this very topic on how to do things, it's starting to get boring.

It's not my job to entertain you.

-------------------------

Chadass | 2024-01-07 22:08:39 UTC | #39

So why are you doing it with so much enthusiasm?

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-07 22:08:55 UTC | #40

With valid questions you mean.

-------------------------

Chadass | 2024-01-07 22:09:31 UTC | #41

No, with nonsense with you enforcing your methods as if it's the only one being valid. And repeating the same thing over and over.

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-07 22:10:20 UTC | #42

I haven't successfully enforced anything. Only Pillars realized that it's a smart approach with their votes.

-------------------------

Chadass | 2024-01-07 22:11:05 UTC | #43

Maybe just leave it to the vote rather than coming up on a daily basis with a reformulation of the same thing.

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-07 22:11:13 UTC | #44

The only condition should be some proof of value creation. I dont care how it's done but I will die on this hill.

I'm allowed to reply like anyone else.

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-07 22:12:05 UTC | #46

Are you done @Chadass? Got any arguments about the proposal?

-------------------------

Chadass | 2024-01-07 22:12:09 UTC | #47

Yeah but how do you measure value? This can be tricky and my point is that mehowz beloved metrics are sometimes not the best way and it should not be the only one. Stay open.

-------------------------

Chadass | 2024-01-07 22:12:36 UTC | #48

No I'm not done, are you ?

-------------------------

Read above.

-------------------------

Chadass | 2024-01-07 22:17:43 UTC | #51

Another problem is that you guys turn the vote into your personal battlefield where you push your personal grief rather than dealing with this privately. This is fucked up and you know it.

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-07 22:14:31 UTC | #52

No reply to my post. What's his distribution plan? What's his nurturing plan? Basics even without metrics.

-------------------------

Again, your methods aren't everyone's and not always the best. Maybe instead of starting useless childish wars you could go back and check Slack sometimes.

Again, your metrics. It'd all about you isn't it ?

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-07 22:16:25 UTC | #59

Distribution is not metrics.

-------------------------

I really don't think you know what you're arguing with anymore @chadass.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-01-07 22:16:52 UTC | #61

This is exactly what I'm proposing and I want to know if the community and pillars support my effort to set the tone for future contributors.

I propose to write an institutional quality investment thesis on NoM with a plan to host it on /zenon-network.  It will not track conversions, funnels, buy clicks and wallet download clicks.  Who ever else decides to host it can track it any way they see fit.

-------------------------

Chadass | 2024-01-07 22:17:07 UTC | #62

Oh I hate this guy, let's start 3 thread to undermine him in different places. Waste of time really.

-------------------------

Chadass | 2024-01-07 22:20:07 UTC | #70

Yeah ok. Read there maybe more often than one time a month.

-------------------------

Nostromo | 2024-01-07 22:20:08 UTC | #71

My suggestion would be not to position this as a marketing proposal. Creating documents can add value to the network, ranging from an investment thesis to technical documentation, graphics, designs, and more. Whether or not that content can then be successfully implemented in a marketing campaign is not relevant to the content creation itself, where the emphasis should be on quality.

My issue with creating an investment thesis is that authoring one at this point in time would be a difficult task to avoid misrepresenting the project and dealing in factual truths. There is no consensus on what the network is and how it is developing.

There is no insight into the founding developers' progress and participation in implementing phase 1 other than some sparse Telegram posts in the past. And from the more vocal developers on the forum, we only have ideas.

I think if you were to write a truly comprehensive investment paper, it would not look very appealing currently.

I believe something more useful would be a detailed technical paper going into the nuts and bolts of the network, how it works, what it's doing, and where it's going.

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-07 22:25:24 UTC | #77

Nobody dictates any specific metrics. Mehowz criticizes the fact that some people want to establish a precedent that no proof of value (or a completely subjective one) should be sufficient to get funded. 

Whatever metrics work can and should be used.

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-01-07 22:25:54 UTC | #78

This is not a bad idea.  I'm open to this suggestion.  However, I want to make clear that the award is independent of the value created, traffic driven, and marketing tools used.  This is a work effort to deliver an investment thesis or roadmap (maybe we can tie the two together).  

The outcome of this vote should help others who want to engage in similar work.  I hope this gives them a roadmap of what to expect when:
- the outcome is uncertain
- there is no funnel or attribution
- the value created cannot be determined easily

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-07 22:39:25 UTC | #80

Can you adjust the wording of your poll then? Because currently it asks to decide whether specific measures must always be applied or not. This framing forces the outcome of the poll and makes it meaningless.

Better: Should AZs be paid on the basis of  proof of value?
Yes/No

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-01-07 22:44:47 UTC | #81

It really just sounds like some people feel that one specific proposal doesn't show value, and rather than just focusing on that specific and salient point (maybe out of courtesy) this has turned into a protracted philosophical and family argument.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-01-07 22:49:50 UTC | #82

I updated what I could.  I'm past the 5 minute cut off to change it. I turned the post into a wiki so you can see all my changes.

-------------------------

Stark | 2024-01-07 22:51:40 UTC | #83

I think it goes without saying that "value creation" is required. The debate is whether or not link attribution and funnels are required in order to substantiate value of a contribution.

As @Nostromo explained, not everything AZ has to be categorized under marketing, or performance marketing.

“value creation” is required.
[/quote]

Yes, but without funnels and attribution, you cannot prove value creation.  I'm proposing something that "should" create value intuitively, and the payment of the AZ is independent of that that.  If I produce high quality work consistent with the scope, I expect payment regardless of the outcome of the work.  This is exactly what I want the pillars and community to vote on.

I see, that's unfortunate because I'm fairly certain the poll would look very differently if people were ssked to agree on whether proof of value is a requirement for AZ or not.

I cant imagine any reason why it wouldnt be and it would clarify any discussions moving forward. 

People can choose themselves how they quantify value. And it is for the grantors to vote on whether that value merits a payout.

I think it has to be a case-by-case thing. We can't extend such a broad statement.

I think it's one of those things were we're trying to avoid being specific on a case by case, by establishing some broad philosophy or policy. Sometimes it's just best to tell someone specifically to take a shower or wash their hair, rather than write a company policy about hygiene. Or just give a person a spot bonus because they deserve it.

Exactly that. It's a slippery slope. I'll vote no. While I appreciate the work on .org I don't see it working for every single proposal. It would make us not agile and would be bothersome.

I'm curious why you would vote no on this AZ but yes on the story book AZ for a higher amount with similar lack of metrics and value prop.

Please help me understand what is different between the two.

I like @Nostromo's suggestion here and timing is also important.

BTC interop is still a big piece that now seems underway but until it is released we should hold off on any technical papers and/or investment thesis.

Can tee up what's known but would prefer to see a final draft after those questions are answered.

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-08 16:58:19 UTC | #90

Agreed. We'll need technical docs and at least an MVP to base the argument on. Not to mention the right list of recipients

-------------------------

WAGMI | 2024-01-08 20:42:26 UTC | #91

I think this is a good idea but something coming from an anon contributor versus a well known fund in the space such as multicoin are TOTALLY different things. Nobody is going to care about a thesis unless its coming from a known analyst, credible fund, or some other already established source. So even if you wrote the best explanation for zenon and a great investment thesis imo it won't move the needle much given everything that is already out there.

Exactly, said the same [here](https://forum.zenon.org/t/zenon-storybook-az/1745/42?u=mehowbrainz).

I respect everything you do for this project 0x but I think the criticism by Nostromo and WAGMI is valid. Going into similar detail about the network as in the Thorchain analysis would have to be based on guesses and possibly poorly informed opinions, since we don't really have the answers to precisely express what our network will look like in the future, due to the decentralized and leaderless nature of this project.

I would also be interested in a detailed technical paper, but I think writing such a paper will require a deep technical understanding of the network and the codebase. I would imagine it would have to be done collaboratively with developers (who would have to spend time figuring out how things work in detail), so I'd assume it would take over 40 hours of combined time to create such a paper.

tapwoot | 2024-01-10 19:37:15 UTC | #95

What if it were written by an anon but then recognized, endorsed and shared by a well known fund / analyst, will that hold the same merits as if it were written by them?

I'm still justifying my yes vote with, the fact we may just need to get the thesis infront of them first, something more professional and less colorful than what currently exists.

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-10 21:45:42 UTC | #96

Then the value comes from the distribution by an entity with a reputation giving it credibility + targeted visibility in the first place. 

Alas, if only there was a way to account for content distribution! /s

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-01-10 22:02:43 UTC | #97

I think we should hold off on this request.  I'm rethinking all the content I create.  And until I can figure that out, let's just let this expire.  My eventual hope was to create a road map for how written content could get approved where the value is unknown initially.  But that will create too much drama in a time when it really does not matter.

Getting closer to Phase I matters and these discussions are too divisive and not productive.

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-11 03:49:22 UTC | #98

Respectfully disagree. These discussions are very important, healthy, and absolutely necessary to ensure setting the right precedents. 

The reason for the controversy and heated discussions is because people deeply care about what precedent will be set. 

In this instance, it has become clear that an investment thesis in particular is only as valuable as the eyeballs and credibility it receives. It's a perfect example of content where distribution makes up 99% of its monetary value.

Dev roadmaps and updates which also primarily serve to coordinate our open source devs (but can also be used as outbound BD content) is to be valued and priced differently, in contrast.

I agree with this feedback, which is why there is no need to discuss this AZ further.
