@georgezgeorgez might be of interest

@0x3639 the dev seems pretty smart. Maybe we can engage him and propose to apply for an AZ grant: "No, this has not been audited. Fuck you, pay me."

He might be interested. Check out his [anti-censorship repo](https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4) inspired by [ScambleSuit](https://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/).
