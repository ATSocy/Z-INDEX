  * Technical debt: I was planning to re-write this code based on Vilkris’ feedback
* 2 hours - Updated UI for multiple address + node select widgets
  * Technical debt: based on user feedback, some parts will need to be updated in the future due to poor visibility for certain elements
* 2 hours - Github actions Release info - tag, message
* 30 hours (probably more) - Implemented Linux support
* 30 hours (probably more) - Updated build process to dynamically copy libs to correct output
* 30 hours (probably more) - Updated MacOS .dmg background image

I converted this to a wiki, so you can edit the post itself.  See upper right of the post.

Like I said before, I don't know how to evaluate my part fairly
I'm open to ideas.

Here's one: distribute the sum of funds equally.

Suggestion for the AZ request: 3k/30k - 5k/50k

I personally feel like you (we) should all be compensated fairly, not a fraction of some number to fit within 5000 / 50000.  Let's see @aliencoder's estimated hours.  Maybe this is two AZs.
