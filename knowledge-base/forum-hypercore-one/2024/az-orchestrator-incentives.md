For discussion:

How about an AZ to pay orchestrators a total of 750 ZNN per month?

That would incentivize 25 orchestrators at a rate of 30 ZNN per month.

Basically unless an orchestrator was a total delinquent, they would be paid each month. If someone has a tech way to monitor orchestrators, incentives could be prorated.

Incentives would be adjusted as ZNN moons.

Thoughts?

Donations rather than using AZ for this

We could try to organize something like this, maybe the community will chime in.

I really wish a portion of the Bridge tax could be used to incentivize the orchestrators.

That doesn't scale with usage.  It should be the bridge tax

That's a very good point about scaling.
