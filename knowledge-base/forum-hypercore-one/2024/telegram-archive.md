In order to preserve and archive the discussions held in the official telegram channel I would like to propose archiving it.  I found an open source [TG Archive Program]( https://github.com/knadh/tg-archive?tab=readme-ov-file ) we can use.  

Here is an example of what the site can look like.
https://tg.fossunited.org/

I would like to archive it to a neutral platform that does not receive any compensation and it does not have any referral links.  This is a site for public good.  

The proposed domain is: tg.zenon.chat 

I think the discussion in telegram will be analyzed by newcomers and providing an archive seems like a worthwhile effort.

Does anyone object?
