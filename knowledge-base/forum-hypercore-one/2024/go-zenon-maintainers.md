Thread: go-zenon-maintainers

The current maintainers of the `go-zenon` [repo](https://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon/) are @0x3639 @sumamu @georgezgeorgez and @MoonBaze .

I would like to propose adding @vilkris as a maintainer for `go-zenon`.  He has been working on `go-zenon` for over a year while trying to design and deploy dynamic plasma.  We've all seen his work and it's exceptional. Vilkris runs a pillar and has been active in the community for years. 

Does anyone object?  If not, I will add him in the coming days.
