Guys, it's been several months since Zen-DAO has participated in Twitter Maintenance.  I think we need to encourage liveliness to remain a maintainer.  Bitcoin regularly removes maintainers who do not remain active.  I would like to propose the same expectation for the Twitter repo.  

Does anyone object?  If not, I think any existing maintainer should be able to propose removing another maintainer, and let the community vote.

No objection here. I'd be happy to keep him as a maintainer if he'd be active though, but unfortunately that does not seem to be the case.

I would like to nominate @Stark as an additional Twitter maintainer.

He has been actively contributing to recent tweets and is a prominent member within our community.
