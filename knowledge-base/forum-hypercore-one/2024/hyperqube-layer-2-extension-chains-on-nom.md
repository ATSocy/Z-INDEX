## Overview
HyperQube is an ecosystem designed to support the creation and development of extension chains (L2's) within the Network of Momentum (NoM). It provides the tools and framework necessary for launching and maintaining these extension chains, enabling developers and contributors to explore new functionalities, scalability options, and decentralized applications in a controlled environment.

At the heart of this ecosystem is HyperQube_Z (HQ_Z), the flagship extension chain of the HyperQube ecosystem, built on NoM’s codebase. HyperQube_Z serves as a betanet where innovative features, contracts, and scalability solutions can be tested without affecting NoM’s mainnet. This structure allows the Zenon community to innovate and iterate while preserving the mainnet's stability and security.

While HyperCore1 (HC1) will maintain HyperQube_Z and the tooling stack, along with other HC1-sponsored chains, the HyperQube tooling can also be used by others to launch additional extension chains that HC1 may not directly maintain, promoting further decentralization and innovation within the NoM ecosystem.

## Why HyperQube_Z Matters

HyperQube_Z accelerates development by increasing participation from both technical and non-technical contributors. Through community-driven governance and structured work packages, contributors are incentivized to complete tasks by participating in well-defined stages of development, including testing, documentation, and maintenance, all of which directly influence the platform's evolution.

The chain empowers the community—developers, non-technical contributors, and pillars alike—to actively shape its direction. This focus on collaborative governance ensures that HyperQube_Z remains adaptable and responsive to the needs of the Zenon ecosystem.

## Placeholder Tokens and Integration with NoM

HyperQube_Z uses Util-Z and Util-Q placeholder tokens as a temporary measure due to the technical requirements of the Zenon architecture. These tokens enable the chain to launch and operate without immediate architectural changes. During system upgrades, placeholder balances may be reset, but xZNN balances will be preserved to ensure continuity.

As HyperQube_Z matures, real ZNN and QSR will be fully integrated, complementing NoM rather than challenging it. Contracts will be developed for cross-chain interactions, enabling ZNN and QSR to benefit from HyperQube_Z-specific contracts, such as a decentralized exchange (DEX), where real-value transactions and fees can be handled in xZNN.

## Work Package 1 (WP1) Deliverables

WP1 marks the initial phase of HyperQube_Z and is focused on establishing the key components needed to make the chain operational. The deliverables for WP1 include:

**1. HyperQube_Z Launch:** Implementing the technical infrastructure to launch the extension chain.

**2. Initial Branding:** Developing the branding for HyperQube_Z, including its logo, website design, and outreach materials, to create a consistent and recognizable identity.

**3. Basic Governance Module***: Deploying a governance module to facilitate community-driven decision-making and establish on-chain governance, critical for long-term decentralized management.

**The governance module will be deployed to HQ_Z initially, but can be seamlessly integrated to mainnet later.*

## Funding Target - WP 1

The HyperQube_Z pillars are initially targeting 15,000 ZNN and 150,000 QSR for WP1, but this amount is not final and may change. Additional AZ's could be requested if needed, especially to complete stretch goals like developing a reusable automated end-to-end test suite.

The funding will be determined through three voting rounds to reach a consensus on the total amount to request and how it will be allocated. These rounds will ensure transparency and collective agreement on the distribution of funds based on the needs and contributions of the participants.

* Round 1: During the planning phase to organize and prepare.
* Round 2: While the work is in progress.
* Round 3: Upon completion of WP1, compensating contributors for the final deliverables.

## Point-Based Funding Distribution

The funds for WP1 will be distributed through a point-based system, rewarding contributors based on their involvement. Pillars can earn points in the admin category by producing momentums on HyperQube and guiding the development through voting.

**Pillars can earn points through the following categories:**
* Pillar sign-up
* Producing momentums on HyperQube_Z
* Active governance through discussions and votes

**Contributors can earn points through the following categories:**
* **Developers:**
-- Node Code
-- Operational Support
-- Testing
-- Docs
-- SDK's
-- Webdev

* **Non-tech:**
-- HyperQube(z) Brand Assets (@Stark)
-- Infographics
-- Memes/Art

***Disclaimer**: The point system recognizes and rewards contributions, but there is no guarantee of a specific payment amount. Reward distribution will be guided by pillar signaling within the incubator, with all payments subject to final approval through the AZ process.* 

## Future Vision

Beyond WP1, HyperQube_Z will continue to evolve, focusing on increasing contributor participation and fostering collaboration. A significant part of this vision is the development of a jobs/tasks platform, where community members can post bounties for various tasks, allowing external developers to pick up smaller tasks and get paid quickly. This will lower the barrier to entry for developers and enhance the efficiency of contributions within the ecosystem.

### Contribute to HyperQube and Earn Rewards

We invite pillars interested in joining the HyperQube_Z effort to contribute and be rewarded for your participation. Your involvement will be crucial to the success of WP1 and the ongoing development of the HyperQube ecosystem.

Additionally, we encourage community contributors to participate in working on the deliverables for WP1. Whether you have technical expertise or can contribute to non-technical tasks, your efforts will directly shape the success of this initiative, and you'll be compensated for your contributions.
