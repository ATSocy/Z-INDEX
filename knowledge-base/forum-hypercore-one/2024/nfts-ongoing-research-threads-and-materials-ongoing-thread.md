There have been discussions about NFTs on the NoM but things have been quite for a bit due to other issues being addressed. I'm trying to keep track with what's happening outside of the NoM and will bring ideas in this post as I find them so we can discuss when the time comes. Here's the first finding:

A thread about the DOS4 NFTc architecture https://twitter.com/p_s_horne/status/1715558774281580999

Abstract: The DOS4 NFTc is a Disk Operating System (DOS) that boots a virtual personal computer (PC) called an NFTc that runs end user software sourced from Ethereum nodes WITHOUT any intermediaries. ● It’s called an NFTc because NFTc provisioning (minting) and ownership management is managed using ERC721 tokens.
