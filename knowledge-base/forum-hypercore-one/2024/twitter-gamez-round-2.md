[Twitter Gamez](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/let-the-twitter-gamez-begin/236) Round 2 starting Monday, 3 Dec 2023.

To enter the game post on twitter with any of these hashtags (#zenon OR #zenonnetwork OR #webz). The game runs for 7 days.  We made a few adjustments to the algo, notably only the top 14 most "valuable" posts are considered in the scoring.  You can tweet more or less, but I recommend you tweet at least 14 times if you want to be competitive.   And if you tweet more than 14 times, that is fine too.  The algo is smart enough to count only highest scoring posts.  

Good luck
