**Project Name:**
Zenon Wallet API

It's built to be compatible with Microsoft .NET 8.0 and requires a Zenon Node for full functionality.

The Zenon Wallet API is part of a [CEX integration guide](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/az-cex-integration-xeggex-and-mercatox) that will help CEXs onboard ZNN & QSR frictionless.

Just wanted to thank @CryptoFish and @digitalSloth for this work.  I got to see first hand what it takes to design and develop a piece of software like this.  I'm really proud of the end product.  I think it will make onboarding to more CEXs very easy.

With v0.1 released and XeggeX going live (hopefully tomorrow) I have everything I need to finish the CEX Integration Guide (separate AZ).  We can present that guide to [Mercatox](https://mercatox.com/) and hopefully they will launch the token.
