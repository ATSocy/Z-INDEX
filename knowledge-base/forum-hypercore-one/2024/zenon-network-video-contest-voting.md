We had an awesome turnout of video submissions for the [Zenon Network Video Contest](https://forum.hypercore.one/t/youtube-video-contest-due-11-feb-2024/315).  Now it up to the community to review and select your favorite video.  The results are anon and I'll be looking for sybil attacks manually.  The winner will receive 150 ZNN and I hope we can get additional donations for the second and third place results.  Submissions are listed in the order we received them.  

Please note, contestants can make corrections / upgrades to their video during the voting period. Feel free to point our any discrepancies or inaccuracies in the submissions.  

> Voting will close 22 Feb 24 at 5PM UTC.

Select your favorite video from the list below.
