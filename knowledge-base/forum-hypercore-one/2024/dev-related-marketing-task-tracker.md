**Notes & Links:**
In order to increase the visibility of Zenon and the confidence in using Syrius wallet (especially on MacOS where you’re prompted to move it to Trash), we need to list it on major AppStores:

* [Windows Store ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/publish-your-app/overview?pivots=store-installer-msix)
* [Mac AppStore ](https://developer.apple.com/macos/submit/)
* [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/store) for Linux
* [Flathub](https://flathub.org/) for Linux

Some info regarding Windows Store:

* Need an MS account (free)
* Need to register a developer account ($20 - requires some level of verification) [Register as an app developer – Windows app development | Microsoft Developer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-store/register/)
* some further reading [Publish your app in the Microsoft Store - Windows apps | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/apps/publish/publish-your-app/overview)
