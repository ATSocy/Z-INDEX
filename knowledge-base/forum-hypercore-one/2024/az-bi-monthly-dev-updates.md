## Update Jan 10

https://forum.hypercore.one/t/az-bi-monthly-dev-updates/304/34?u=0x3639

## Proposal

Write a community developer update every two months for the year 2024 and post them on zenon.info.  Here are samples of prior developer updates I have written.  

[December 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-community-update-december-2023/)
[August 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-community-update-august-2023/)
[July 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-community-update-may-july-2023/)
[April 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-april-2023-community-update/)
[March 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-march-2023-community-update/)
[February 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-february-2023-community-update/)
[January 2023](https://www.zenon.info/zenon-network-january-2023-update/)

Each update takes me on average four hours to write PLUS the time I spend every day to be aware of all development activities.  In order to write these updates I've built the trust of the developers and they feel comfortable telling me what they are working on if I cannot see their work.  ChatGPT cannot write these updates and ChatGPT cannot earn the trust of a developer.  And we cannot hire a random technical writer online to do this work.  I don't think anyone would talk to them.  I make every effort to write the dev section of the update myself with limited to no input from any developer.

The developer updates are used by the community to understand the status of the project and the developers themselves read them to learn what others are doing.  Some guys work silently by themselves and have no idea what others are doing.

I cannot tell you the value of the posts nor should the AZ depend on the current or future value of the posts.  I am not proposing to integrate any funnels that track conversions, downloads of syrius, bridge events, or any performance metrics.  I can report the page views and I can track clicks on links, but I am proposing a simple Developer Update (per the 7 samples) that I know are useful to the community.  And, from what I can tell in Telegram, the community likes them.  

For example, the Jan 2023 dev update received 473 views by 255 users and the average engagement was 2 minutes 27 seconds.  I can share these metrics for each post going forward, but the payout is not a function of their success.

I'm asking to be compensated for my time to produce work that I think the community believes is useful, but the value is unknown. I'm also proposing no performance metrics on purpose because I do not believe ALL marketing can be measured on metrics alone.

For example, when Mr. Beast posted his [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XVcLrB7B3Y) do you think the metrics were good?  And if he simply relied on those metrics to determine the value of the work would he be the media giant he is today?  I believe you can create value over time with a sustained marketing effort, but the value is not readily apparent (initially).  I think the dev updates and many of the articles I post on .info fit into this category.  Check out how the grass roots marketing of kaspa evolved over time.  From what I can tell value creation is not a requirement for rewards.  There is some shitty marketing for sure, but when taken together they have a big footprint with some quality work with no VC funding.  

When we pumped the other day I had an article written for every question that came up in Telegram and anyone following at that time can attest to that.  I cannot tell you the value of that, but we had answers to questions.

## Funding Request

100 znn per article for 6 articles = 600 znn paid out in two increments (month 6 and month 12).  Justification assumes 4 hours per article at $50USD per hour at $2/ZNN => (6)(4)(50)/2 = 600 znn

I'm happy to share a portion of the funding with anyone who helps with artwork as others have in the past.  

## License For Work

If I receive reimbursement for the work, it will be licensed under this model.  I've added this license due to the insane conversation below.  This content is not intended to be monetized, funneled, ground up, repackaged, and linked all over the place in an effort to profit from it or get delegators.  It's a simple dev update on what the community is doing that is shared on a neutral platform for the good of the project.

## Community Support

* YES I support this AZ
* NO I do not support this AZ

tapwoot | 2024-01-09 01:51:50 UTC | #2

I think doesn't need to be justified for any further because If or When Zenon is a success we will need a reputable history to refer back to. I'm voting yes

I'll shoot one your way, since this is your 2nd attempt:

Silly approach if the tools exist and it would actually make your content more valuable at no disadvantage to you. It's clear your proposal has two intentions: attempt to develop a precedent for marketing that's purposely unmeasured, while masking the ill-intent motives with your reputation as a contributor and work you've produced. You should've had labeled this as an operational expense for the network IMO. But you're labelling it as marketing to discredit the need for performance for future (poor) AZ's in the marketing category. Marketing will always require proof. Operations, to a lesser extent than marketing.

I agree on the vote for your contributions (yes to pay you), I disagree with the way you've once again misformulated the proposal (this is your 2nd shot in a row at Attribute and performance tech benefits for the network, you did the same with the last one re: thesis with your first poll, this time you kept Attribute keywords out of the equation).

Silly and scrappy as usual. Had to call you out.

Going forward dev updates if paid by AZ (hopefully they will), will be reposted on Org and used alongside performance systems to prove new value generated to the network. I believe I've offered many opportunities for collaboration/guidance on best practices, but enough is enough. I'll build the evidence with contributors I don't have to argue-with anymore. There's a bunch who believe in the vision and needs for evidence-based marketing, especially when it comes to articles. I do agree that *some* marketing forms may have a bit more difficulty with Attribute-included campaigns, but articles are the prime channels for performance strategies. You don't want to include for the sake of trying to make a weak point. I'm making mine now.

-------------------------

SultanOfStaking | 2024-01-09 02:47:23 UTC | #4

Does this include moderating the dev meetings? I think it would make sense to lump these.

Also re value, I believe you can always find a way to track value. Directly using tools like MehowBrains is suggesting or through another means like innovation accounting / leading indicators.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-01-09 02:47:35 UTC | #5

@mehowz License updated to reflect your desire to commercialize it.  Please vote accordingly.

Haha, that's fair. 2 people including yourself had already voted before you added the license. What a mess. Changing the terms of your proposal on the fly.

Sure.  When we have them I'm happy to do that.

Question for everyone: What happens when AZ pays for work? Owned by the network? Can it be continuously licensed? Uncharted territories.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-01-09 02:52:28 UTC | #10

It should be set by the applicate and approved by the pillars.  If they don't like the license, don't approve it.

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-09 02:53:11 UTC | #11

What if the payouts go to Attribute marketers, which could be anyone in the community including your own links. Do you sue yourself and/or the community?

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-01-09 02:54:27 UTC | #12

no idea.  Read the license and vote accordingly.

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-09 02:55:14 UTC | #13

From "I don't trust Google and tracking and am fully onboard with decentralization and openness" to "I set a license on work AZ is reimbursing me for"

0x3639 | 2024-01-09 02:57:26 UTC | #14

I'm not trying to monomerize content.  I'm trying to help the community.  And that is what this AZ is for.  It's not to commercialize it, monetize it, yield farm it, funnel it, convert it into delegators.  it's to help the community.

[/quote]

Placing your content on Org won't commercialize it, it'll just become more visible to a wider audience while serving the community and network as it'll be a driving vehicle to attract new participation with performance frameworks Org is building. Don't worry it'll be fine, hoping your AZ goes through for your payment. You deserve it.

-------------------------

SultanOfStaking | 2024-01-09 03:00:53 UTC | #16

I’d rather you link a metric to what you want to see come of these updates. Is your goal for more people to read it, more people to say it is helpful, for the updates to generate discussions? You can track any / all of these. Wouldn’t just measure for the sake of measuring but think how you will define success personally and how you will track that.

If the goal is just to have these merely “exist” that’s fine too but I think we can strive for more

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-01-09 03:06:05 UTC | #17

honestly i think the goal is to keep everyone informed and excited about our developments.  And when someone new comes in and asks for an update on development, we can give one.  That is my goal.  If the community wants to share them on twitter that's awesome but I don't have a plan to market or advertise these any differently than we have been today: TG, twitter, etc.

As I said above, sounds like it's an operational expense for the network. Mislabelled as marketing. Hope you get rewarded, you work very hard.

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-09 03:33:36 UTC | #19

I don't think your license is valid though. "No derivatives or adaptations of your work are permitted." Dev updates are dev updates, I don't think there's anything proprietary about ecosystem updates (which will get mentioned and written by others, in various shapes and forms). Sounds restrictive to only allow 1 brand to own such information in perpetuity, and especially if paid by AZ. Can a brand even own what's typically public information? Lol

-------------------------

SultanOfStaking | 2024-01-09 03:48:06 UTC | #20

The addition of the license doesn’t quite jibe with the just trying to help the community vibe. I think emotions are driving too many comments on AZ today. Time to step away for a bit…

-------------------------

mehowz | 2024-01-09 04:07:21 UTC | #21

I think he should also make the added license more clear in his proposal. It's positioned after voting poll box. Looks a little hidden, even though we know it was an after-thought people should be made aware that the license is part of the proposal and voting.

-------------------------

0x3639 | 2024-01-09 09:32:13 UTC | #22

OK, at your request I have moved it above the vote.

I agree with this standpoint, voted yes on your proposal zir.

> As I said above, sounds like it’s an operational expense for the network. Mislabelled as marketing. Hope you get rewarded, you work very hard.

@Mehowz you are right here to an extent that this proposal might be mislabelled as marketing. But as 0x has stated, the focus here is about providing information. We can potentially track conversions through the ORG website after something is posted, but it may not be essential for every content creator to provide a detailed plan on how they'll measure conversions.

While using a funnel to track conversions can be effective, we should also consider that not all community members may want to, or know how to track conversions. Another example would be Zyler's storybook. His contributions may not be directly related to marketing, but we shouldn't overlook the importance of quality content. This would be up to the individual Pillars to decide if it's valuable.

It's crucial to distinguish between creating valuable content and getting people to see it. Using the funnel to track traffic from Zenon.org makes sense, but in my honest opinion, applying it to the content itself and its creators may not be as important in some cases. The community voices their opinion as most of us have been here for a long time, and we act on reputation and good faith. That's an important aspect to take into account when it comes to our network.

-------------------------

build_republic | 2024-01-09 14:51:41 UTC | #24

Your contributions to NoM are clearly evident @0x3639 and we will vote yes without hesitation.

Our only feedback (perhaps more broadly to the community) on "developer comms" is the prioritization of professional documentation that can help developers get started on NoM faster.  

In the same way Stripe is well known for onboarding developers because of their world-class docs, it will be critical for the success of NoM in the long-run.

Dev updates can attract dev readers right? Imagine you have a static funnel designed to onboard them into the network as participants. His proposal is specifically designed to show the network that you don't need to care about completing the marketing cycle / proving some conversions (if you don't want to). That's fair, but what a wasted opportunity no? I mean you just developed content, you got some relevant readers, why not try to go full cycle? All it requires is a backlink to a funnel that would've been aimed at developers, and would've been branded as his brand and hosted by his sub-domain. The backlink would've been linked within a call to action at the end of the post, calling for new participation via some specific keyword his brand would've wanted to rank-for in search engines (all benefits to him and his brand). See how easy it would've been? 1 link lol and it can prove that his specific update lead to a new participation.

1. I agree with his contribution, he works hard and dev updates are valuable.

2. I don't agree with the ill-intent to label this as a marketing proposal if he purposely states that he doesn't want to have anything to do with marketing. It's a network operations proposal. Let's not confuse future marketing AZ's on what marketing really is: proof of conversion for the network.

3. I don't agree that dev updates should be licensed. Pillars should be careful for this one. Anyone who then makes similar posts/efforts can be attacked in various forms. And this is exactly what @0x3639 will do, he added the license after I mentioned that: if he doesn't want to get attributed for the efforts, Org will do that for the network via dev updates on its blog. I mean he wants to check 1 box, that's fine. We'll fill in the rest for the network, that's why we're here -- and especially if AZ is paying for his content. Network owned from that on. I don't think any Pillar can dictate how network-owned material is used. Just like we require code to be open sourced if paid by AZ, anyone can use it was they wish. You can't have it all @0x3639, you want to get paid, you open it for the network.

Expect to see similar dev updates on various publications @0x3639 if you get paid by AZ. Saying it now: he'll do everything to be right and claim copyright infringement on behalf of the network for anything that remotely resembles his content. It's pretty nuts what he's trying to do. Imagine Org wants to campaign on each individual dev update point, in the outbound to attract new participants. He's going to try to prevent that? Lol good luck bud.

If Pillars vote yes, they're inadvertently voting that any content from his updates cannot be mentioned by anyone else in the network. A NoM Bridge code update is not his property, he just reports it. He should remove that provision from his proposal. Be careful what you vote for everyone. This is quite concerning.

-------------------------

Shazz | 2024-01-10 04:59:11 UTC | #27

I voted no. Not because I think you shouldn't get paid for your effort, but because you  impose a license which restricts reusing the content which you want to get paid for through an AZ. 

That makes no sense and fundamentally opposes the FOSS principle of AZ grants. 

You can't have it both ways.

Ps. The only thing you can enforce is protection agains plagiarism. Any other source properly citing your content can do so freely anyway.

[/quote]

This is the spirit of the `license`. This is a simple dev update that is not intended to be monetized or levered for the benefit of anyone or any organization.  So what ever you call that license, that is what I propose.

mehowz | 2024-01-09 15:40:33 UTC | #29

Dude give up the license, you don't even know how it works. You probably ChatGPT'd it as soon as I said I'd repurpose content to drive traffic and participation to the network. Move your emotions aside, get paid from AZ and move on if you don't want to do marketing. You're a good operational contributor and your payment terms are more fair than any other we've had.

mehowz | 2024-01-09 16:32:15 UTC | #31

Well @ Network now you can see how emotional @0x3639 got for being called out on intentions. My terms remain the same:

1. Remove the license, anything paid by AZ is open.
2. Be clear that given you're not intending to participate in marketing activities, this doesn't classify as a marketing AZ but rather operational. Need to set the right precedents here. Marketing requires evidence of performance in some shape or form -- and especially when tools are given to drive new participants into the network, it doesn't require much effort from content creators: at minimum add a call to action to lead new participation, learn to distribute to generate relevant traffic, be willing to iterate to maximize effects ([more here](https://forum.zenon.org/t/performance-marketing-proposal-guidelines/918)).

-------------------------

vilkris | 2024-01-10 08:26:25 UTC | #32

As a developer these are an easy way to keep tabs on what other developers are doing and are a form of documentation. I want to focus my time on development work, and it's time consuming to continuously keep tabs on all the other developments that are happening within this project. So these updates are definitely worth the funds in my opinion.

I still have to vote abstain for now since I'm not sure what to think about the license in this type of an AZ request. It seems like a minor detail, especially when this is a fairly small request but I wonder what precedent it will be setting.

Guys, I would like to stop the voting on this AZ.  It's becoming clear this is becoming a distraction and especially for the devs who are most valuable.  The fact that @vilkris had to read through this and take time away from Dynamic Plasma is a huge mistake.  

So let's please stop the voting and let's focus on building great stuff.  I have a new idea that will not waste any brain cells or create drama.  

I intend to continue writing the dev updates no matter what.
