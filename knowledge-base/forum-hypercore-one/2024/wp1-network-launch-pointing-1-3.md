Round 1 of 3
Please see the following work package and discuss/vote on relative value of the Network Launch work of [HC1: HyperQube SIG WP1 - Zenon Wiki ](https://zenon.wiki/index.php/HC1:_HyperQube_SIG_WP1)

The Network Launch work is comprised of individual work items which we want to assign points to:

* Pillar Sign Up Method (through signatures and AZ)
* Launch Code & Config (go-zenon fork and genesis file)
* Operational Support (instructions & scripts)
* Pillar Momentum Pointing (maybe just bundle with explorer)
* Explorer
* Future/Bonus (gives us wiggle room to adjust)

As a baseline, the work package starts with 10k points allocated for pillar momentums and votes and 10k points for the work package coordinator, for a total of 20k points.

Round 1 happens during the planning phase.
Round 2 happens as the work is in progress.
Round 3 happens once the work is done.

Quick template:

pillar sign up: X points
launch code & config: X points
operational support: X points
pillar momentum pointing: X points
explorer: X points
future/bonus: X points

Part of me is unsure if it is worth the effort to prove fair launch. There will be no token sale or custody of assets. There will be big disclaimers saying that the future of the native tokens is uncertain and that they should be treated as utility tokens with no efforts being made to positively impact a price, if a market even exists.

Extension chains serve a group of people. They don't have to be all-inclusive.
