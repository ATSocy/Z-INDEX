Work is currently in progress to [unify the Syrius desktop and mobile](https://forum.zenon.org/t/unifying-the-desktop-and-mobile-repos-plus-more/1940) repositories. This work needs to be reviewed and tested in order to successfully integrate and release the work.

Incentives for maintaining the Syrius project fall outside the scope of John's proposals. Therefore as a chair of the Syrius SIG, I would like to apply and setup an AZ fund to pay for the work done by maintainers to maintain and operate Syrius and its repositories.

The long term goal is to create a system where developers and maintainers have an idea ahead of time of what they can be paid for different work items. This system is currently being applied to some of Georges SIGs.

Long term, we have plans for joint payout methods where all contributions to getting a piece of work delivered can be paid out together in a trust less way. No one will need to custody funds for others or pay from their own.

Also, a robust CI/CD system can reduce the amount of work needed to review PRs. Work for setting this up will be payed from this fund.

I will be asking a full AZ fund. The fund will be neccessary until it is depleted or replaced by another system. The work done will be reported as done in previous projects and phases will be submitted when the work is fully tesed, integrated and released.


This proposal outlines a well-structured plan for sustaining and enhancing the Syrius project through a dedicated AZ fund, supporting both the immediate needs of repository unification and ongoing project maintenance. Here’s a summary and key considerations for moving forward:

* **Fund Purpose and Allocation**: The AZ fund will primarily cover work related to maintaining and operating the Syrius repositories, ensuring stable development and streamlined operations. This fund addresses a critical gap, as existing incentives do not currently cover this essential maintenance.

* **Repository Unification and Testing**: Unifying the desktop and mobile Syrius repositories is a pivotal step toward a more cohesive user experience and streamlined development process. Thorough review and testing of the unification efforts are essential to avoid fragmentation and ensure a smooth integration, which is critical for a successful release.

* **Long-Term Pay Structure**: Developing a system to define payment expectations in advance for various work items provides clarity and incentivizes developers and maintainers. This system is already being explored in other SIGs, which may serve as a model for the Syrius SIG. Setting predictable compensation encourages consistency and allows maintainers to prioritize their efforts effectively.

* **Joint Payout and Trustless Payment Mechanism**: The proposed trustless, joint payout method is innovative and aligns with the decentralized ethos of the Zenon project. This approach not only reduces the administrative burden but also ensures fair compensation distribution, as funds can be allocated directly to contributors without intermediaries or custodial control.

* **CI/CD Improvements**: Establishing a robust CI/CD system will reduce the workload associated with reviewing pull requests, a critical step toward more sustainable project management. Funding this initiative ensures that resources are allocated toward automating and streamlining testing and integration processes, ultimately enhancing the project’s reliability and release cadence.

* **Fund Depletion and Transition Plan**: By setting a goal for the fund to remain active until depleted or replaced by an alternative system, the proposal accommodates both immediate and future project needs. A phased reporting system upon completion of fully tested, integrated, and released work will enhance transparency and accountability.
