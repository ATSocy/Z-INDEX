I saw some Twitter posts saying that ledger is monitoring our signing activities through the hardware wallet.

Is this a concern?

This is the post.

Those posts concern the Ledger Live desktop application.

Ledger Live is mainly used for account management and to manage the installed apps on a Ledger device. They do not monitor the signing activities, singing happens on the Ledger device and not within Ledger Live.
