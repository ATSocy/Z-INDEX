All Hyperqube registered pillars are invited to ask a question for discussion during the 2024 HC1: State of the Network call.

**QUESTION:** Do you think any BTC integration between Zenon Network and Bitcoin Network will be accomplished with a zApp?  Or do you think the integration will be something more fundamental that requires separate embedded contracts and/or network plumbing?

**QUESTION:** This cycle has brought significant attention to BTC L2s, with projects like STX leading the charge.

What gives the HC-1 team confidence that Zenon can compete with heavily VC-backed ecosystems, and how can the community collaborate to succeed in this sector?

**Question**(s) (might as well in case you run out of them :slight_smile:). Feel free to pick the one you like best.

Over the last three years, we’ve witnessed several notable developments—some predictable, like Mr. Kaine completely ghosting his account, and others more surprising, such as a network fork requiring urgent patching or the pillars approving an Accelerator-Z marketing payout to someone who later disappeared.

I’d like to delve into a few key aspects of the network, from its open-sourcing to its current state. Below are some thoughts and questions regarding different components:

---

**Accelerator-Z:**
In hindsight, do you believe Accelerator-Z has been effective in achieving its intended goals? What specific improvements would you suggest for AZ?

---

**Syrius:**
Syrius seems to be the fastest-evolving project in the ecosystem. As the primary wallet and interface for the network, did you expect it to develop at this pace compared to other network efforts?

---

**Ecosystem and Community Growth:**
While we’re starting to see promising ecosystem development efforts, such as users building ZTS and PFP collections, growth has been relatively stagnant for most of the time.

* What do you think is the primary bottleneck hindering sustained community growth or ecosystem development?

---

**Go-Zenon:**
Beyond a few patches and the deployment of embedded contracts, we haven’t seen significant changes to Go-Zenon. While some optimizations have been proposed, the network has run stably for three years.

* Is this speed of development expected for such a critical piece of the infrastructure?

---

**Bridge:**
After the initial BNB chain incident, we’ve relied exclusively on an ETH bridge to onboard users and incentivize liquidity providers. The original website seemed to aim for multi-chain support.

* Have we become hesitant about implementing bridges due to risks, or is this more about a lack of community initiative?

---

**Documentation:**
There’s been increasing discussion around onboarding more developers. Aliencoder has shown initiative in improving network documentation.

* As developers, do you see documentation as a significant bottleneck for growth?
* Or is the existing **wiki.zenon.network** sufficient to get new developers started?

---

**Sentinels:**
Development of sentinel nodes seems to be taking longer than anticipated. For three years, sentinels have received 'free' yield.

* Did you expect this duration initially, or do you see this as an issue needing resolution?
* Would you have preferred emissions to be directed toward AZ and active contributors instead of sentinels?

If professor E answers this before the SOTN, I'll ask a different question. I think he implied that the answer is in the whitepaper, but I don't know. Essentially, my question is whether a personal will be able to launch a zApp, supply it with QSR, and the zApp could run perpetually on NoM.

**Question**

Considering the overall progress of the last two yrs along with the ongoing testing of PTLC's, whats the state of incorporating some layer of privacy in the Network? 

Is there a direction that would have the most potential for building some real utility with privacy in mind or is something like Bitcoin IBD the first major goal in that sense?
