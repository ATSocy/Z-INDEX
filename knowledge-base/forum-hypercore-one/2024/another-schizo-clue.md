It looks like you're working on a couple of mathematical problems involving a system of equations and a conversion of letters to their numerical position in the alphabet, followed by some computations. Here's a breakdown:

1. **System of Equations**:
   - You have two equations: ( 4y - 2x = 28 ) and ( y = 3(x-1) ).
   - Substituting the second equation into the first, you derived:
     - ( 4(3x - 3) - 2x = 28 )
     - Simplifying gives ( 10x - 12 = 28 ), then ( 10x = 40 ), and ( x = 4 ).
     - Substituting ( x = 4 ) back, ( y = 9 ).
   - Everything looks correct in your solution for \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Letter to Number Conversion and Multiplication**:
   - You converted the letters Z, N, N, Q, S, R to their positions in the alphabet and summed them up to get 108.
   - Separately, you computed ( 1 times x times y = 1 times 4 times 3 times 9 = 108 ), which matches the sum from the letters.

3. **Final Interpretation**:
   - It appears you connected the calculation ( 1x3y = 108 ) to a string "ZNNQSR", implying a correlation via numerical value.

Overall, the math checks out, and the connections you've made between different parts of the problem seem logically consistent based on what you've shown. If you have a specific question about this work or need further clarification, let me know!
