**What is HyperCore.One?**

HyperCore.One is comprised of HyperCore developers who have organically come together as individual contributors to form a team capable of delivering end-to-end value to the Zenon Ecosystem.

This end-to-end delivery model includes:

* research / proof-of-concept
* delivery planning and breakdown
* implementation
* ecoystem protocols, interfaces, sdks
* UI and UX
* holistic testing
* software release lifecycle
* community education
* external marketing material

This tightly integrated delivery model will enable us to show value at every milestone and work within a project/payout cadence that is agreeable given the volatility of the networkâ€™s native assets.

Question: On the zenon.org website I can promote to new devs to either form their own teams, or join existing HyperCore teams. Are you open to have newcomers join, or prefer if they're guided to join other teams / make their own?
