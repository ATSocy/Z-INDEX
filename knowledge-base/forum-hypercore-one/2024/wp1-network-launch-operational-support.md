Coordination thread for operational support work

-------------------------

I will nominate @0x3639 to work with HC1: OP SIG to complete this work.

In terms of acceptance criteria. At a high level:

* Deployment script/method
* Pillar/node launch instructions/guide/faq
  * Include hardware requirements/suggestion (network throughput will likely be less than mainnet)
* Misc pre-launch/launch support 

The median incentives signaled by the pillars for round 1:

Network Launch Ops
3000 / 80250 Points
561 / 15k ZNN
5607 / 150k QSR

If members in OP SIG help, you can tip them. Or if substantial, you can make a case in round 2&3 voting when it comes to the 4500 bonus/placeholder points allocated to Network Launch.

**Disclaimer** : The payment amounts provided herein are intended as guidelines only and do not constitute a binding offer or guarantee of payment. The HyperQube Incubator framework works with Zenon Network Pillars to signal incentives which are subject to change over multiple rounds. Actual payment amounts will be based on Accelerator-Z grants that depend on the voting rules and requirement of Accelerator-Z.

@0x3639 do you accept?

Where should we host / write this and when do we need it function by?

I think any sort of living document probably belongs on the wiki.
We need to get a bit serious about backing up this discourse and the wiki.

In terms of target dates, it will depend on when the code work has made enough progress. That should start fairly soon.

For now, just start templating things out with placeholders etc.
It is go-zenon based, so there's probably a lot of reusable work you've done already.

The forum is being backed up on multiple levels.  
- I take VM backups daily
- All images and uploads are saved to S3 hosted at DO
- We run a local backup script in the Discourse software that dumps the DB and images to S3 on digital ocean.  

I can document this somewhere also.

@0x3639 any update on this?
I just put in my update:

Sorry for the delay. I know your work is dependent on mine.
Anything blocking you from progress?
