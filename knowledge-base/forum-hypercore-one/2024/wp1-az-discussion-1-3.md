Based on discussion within the https://matrix.to/#/#sig-hyperqube:hc1.chat, we have an initial target of 3-4 AZ for https://zenon.wiki/index.php/HC1:_HyperQube_SIG_WP1.

Which Javascript SDK is being referred to on the wiki?

We'll get into detail when we assign it points. I think there are existing but old javascript/typescript sdks:

* https://github.com/alien-valley/znn.js
* https://github.com/DexterLabZ/znn.ts

The scope would be limited to only what is needed for the governance embedded once that is spec'd out.
My use case is for the adversarial testing (load/performance, e2e) with the https://k6.io/ framework.

I think the sophistication of our testing will be a factor in our total AZ ask.
I have a slot for adversarial testing but that could comprise of manual testing by community members or creating reusable test suites with k6. If we are able to do something fairly automated and reusable, I think it could warrant at least another AZ.
