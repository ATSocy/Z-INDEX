Opening a formal discussion to discuss listing ZNN on the exchange "nonkyc"

The name obviously implies potential regulation issues, but several respected community members have expressed support for this.

Whereas nonkyc looks nearly identical to Xeggex, I imagine the integration of native ZNN will go smoothly.

The listing happens through a application form and the funding amount has to be deposited into the account.

Account has been created and EVM address is retrieved.

Next steps would be to sign the multisig and send the funds to our account on Nonkyc.

Update zoon.
