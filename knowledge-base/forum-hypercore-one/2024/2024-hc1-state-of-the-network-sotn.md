HyperCore One members @georgezgeorgez @0x3639 and @vilkris will be having a voice call on Dec 1, 2024 11 AM EST to mark the 3 year NoM anniversary. Exact time TBD.

We may discuss items such as:
* HC1 Vision
* Current work
* Future roadmap
* The crypto industry & landscape
* Macroeconomic conditions
* Other random topics

I will invite all registered Hyperqube pillars to ask a single question, and I'll try and get through them all.
