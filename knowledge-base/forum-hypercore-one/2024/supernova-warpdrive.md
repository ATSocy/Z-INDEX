I suggest we should do a warp drive for supernova in order to attract builders. We now have EVM and we need protocols deployed on it.

We could have the following areas of interest:

DeFi - trading pools, staking, lending, flash loans
DAO
Gaming
Social
Utilitaries - explorer like etherscan, dex screener, multi sigs
NFT / Metaverse

The program could offer bounties for them up to 100k ZNN and 1kk QSR (e.g.) in total from the Accelerator. It would be huge for us as it attracts developers and their communites on Supernova. Also a faster on ramp is needed. 
Let's discuss what do you think we need and how much are we willing to pay for it. It is also a very good marketing for ZNN

Can you elaborate on this?  Are you saying we need a different bridge experience to get onto Supernova?

Right now users have to buy on Ethereum, unwrap on NoM then wrap again on Supernova. It takes some time and the process is kind of annoying as they have to also use Syrius. We could use a solution where only metamask is needed as in EVM to EVM. One example would be to have funds on both networks and when someone swap from Ethereum, we wait for confirmations and send them on Supernova, in a centralized manner but faster. The same in the other direction and there should be funds balancing from one to the other. Each swap should have a fee.

A bridge like orbiter finance is what we need. Cheap and fast.

all of this sounds interesting and needed

I totally agree. The community can vote the categories and prizes for each category.
