Does anyone have experience with this protocol - Bittorent File System for Web3?   Looks like this is different that traditional torrent system.

No, but reading it I do remember Bittorrent needs a centralized tracker so I wonder how they managed that.

Plus. Tron.

Even if you don't host . torrent you still need a tracker which rely on an IP or an URL.
