I just deployed a link shortening service for @sumamu to support this initiative. 

https://forum.zenon.org/t/perpetual-ecosystem-growth/1417

In the near future marketers will visit https://affiliate.zenon.community to generate a referral link.  It will also come with a shortened link that will be in the format https://znn.link/xxxxx

I used this open source project https://shlink.io/ for the link shortening service.  I containerized it along with Caddy, mysql and an API interface.  Seems to work well.

Does it work right now?

it should, but only this domain [https://affiliate.zenon.community](https://affiliate.zenon.community/) can create the actual link.
