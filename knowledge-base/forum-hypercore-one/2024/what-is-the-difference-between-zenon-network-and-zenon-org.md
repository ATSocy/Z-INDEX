**What is Zenon Network?**

[Zenon Network](https://zenon.network) is a community run digital ecosystem designed to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain technology. Described as a "self-evolving planetary-scale super organism," Zenon Network aims to create a secure, scalable, and truly decentralized ecosystem. Its dual token, PoW and PoS protocol moves beyond the blockchain trilemma.

**What about Zenon.org?**

Zenon.org, on the other hand, is a private organization that plays an important role within the Zenon Network ecosystem. However, itâ€™s important to understand that Zenon.org is not the same as Zenon Network. Zenon.org focuses on performance marketing and operates several Pillars (validators) in the network. They have developed proprietary, closed-source tools to enhance their marketing efforts and support the ecosystem.

**Key Differences:**

* **[Zenon Network](https://zenon.network)**: Community-driven, digital ecosystem aiming to deliver a blockchain that is secure, scalable, and truly decentralized.
* **Zenon.org**: Private company involved in marketing Zenon Network, operating several validators with a focus on performance marketing and proprietary tools.
