Work thread for infographics

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-15 15:32:33 UTC | #2

I think the FAQ would be a good starting point for infographics.
And probably once the governance work is underway, that will warrant an infographic or two.

I like the term BetaNet.

But hyperqube_z is a bit more than a testnet.
The incubator will very much be a prod incubator.
We will offer production xZNN compatible bleeding edge contracts for those who want to use them.

I understand it's a bit confusing though.
Some aspects of the network are more for testing than others.
And what those aspects are will change over time as well.

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-10-17 18:30:53 UTC | #6

Is it a testnet with some production features? Bad design.
Is it a production network with some testing features? That's okay, and happens a lot in the real world.

### Infographic 1: "Why Build on HyperQube_Z First?"

This idea highlights the **key differences in workflow** when implementing features, contracts, or updates through **HyperQube_Z** versus directly on **NoM's mainnet**. The goal is to demonstrate the **advantages of using HyperQube_Z as an experimental environment** compared to the risks and limitations of deploying directly on the baselayer.

---



#### **Main Theme:**

Compare the collaborative, efficient, and safe workflow enabled by **HyperQube_Z** with the risks, delays, and limitations of implementing changes directly on **NoM mainnet**.

---

### **HyperQube_Z Workflow:**

1. **Open Collaboration**
* **Description:** HyperQube_Z enables an environment where multiple contributors, developers, and community members can collaborate openly, pooling their skills and resources.
* ***Visual:** A group of interconnected nodes or people working together, symbolizing teamwork and collaboration.*
2. **Faster Payouts Through Work Packages**
* **Description:** Contributors are incentivized with structured work packages and clear deliverables, ensuring quicker compensation for their efforts.
* ***Visual:** A timeline with milestones and "Fast Payouts" badges for completed tasks.*
3. **Transparency, Reliability, Safety**
* **Description:** The governance and test-first approach of HyperQube_Z fosters trust and ensures that experimentation is conducted in a controlled, reliable manner without jeopardizing Zenon’s mainnet stability.
* ***Visual:** A padlock symbol next to a testnet, ensuring safety.*

 #### VS

### **NoM Mainnet Workflow:**

1. **Solo Work or Closed Collaboration**
  * **Description:** Changes to the mainnet often rely on limited contributors or small teams, restricting the pace and scope of development.
  * ***Visual:** A single developer working alone at a desk with "Restricted Access" signage.*
2. **Needs Rigorous Review (Slower)**
  * **Description:** All changes must undergo extensive peer review to minimize risks, which delays implementation and slows innovation.
  * ***Visual:** A clock ticking with "Pending Review" text overlaying.*
3. **Potential Network Risks**
  * **Description:** Any issue or bug introduced on the mainnet can have widespread consequences, risking the network’s reliability and security.
  * ***Visual:** A cracked shield representing damage to the network.*

### **Infographic 2:** "What is the HyperQube Ecosystem?"


This infographic explains the HyperQube ecosystem by breaking it into its core components. It highlights the main differences between HyperQubes and Non-HyperQubes, clarifies the role of HyperQube_Z, and shows how it complements the baselayer.

---

### **Infographic Structure:**

#### **Main Heading:**

"What is the HyperQube Ecosystem?"

---

### **Section 1: The Foundation - NoM Mainnet**

* **Description:**
**NoM's baselayer** serves as the foundational layer of Zenon Network. It provides security, decentralization, and stability for the entire ecosystem.

* ***Visual:** Represent the NoM Mainnet as a large, central circle labeled "NoM Mainnet," with connecting arrows extending outward to show its interaction with extension chains.*

---

### **Section 2: HyperQubes**

* **Description:** HyperQubes are Layer 2 extension chains that are launched using HC1's tooling stack. They allow developers to build scalable solutions and experiment with innovative functionalities while benefiting from streamlined processes and support.
  * **Maintained by HC1:** Some HyperQubes are HC1-sponsored chains and are actively maintained by HC1.
  * **Independent HyperQubes:** Other HyperQubes are launched independently, though they still use the HC1 tooling stack for creation and management.
  * **Core Difference:** The **main distinction** between HyperQubes and Non-HyperQubes is that all HyperQubes rely on HC1 tooling, making their setup and upgrades more structured and efficient.
* **Features:**
  * Enables collaboration and experimentation.
  * Provides scalability for decentralized applications.
  * Open to both HC1-maintained and independently managed HyperQubes.

* ***Visual:** Show smaller cubes labeled "HyperQubes," some with HC1 sponsorship (bold labels) and others independent, all connected to the NoM Mainnet via clear lines to represent cross-chain interactions.*

---

### **Section 3: Non-HyperQubes**

* **Description:** These are extension chains launched **independently of HC1's tooling stack**. Developers can create and manage these chains without relying on HyperQube but may still interact with the NoM Mainnet if desired.
* **Features:**
  * Independent operation and management.
  * Optional integration with the NoM ecosystem.
  * Requires custom tooling for launch and upgrades, unlike HyperQubes.

* ***Visual:** Display **circles** labeled "Non-HyperQubes" farther from the NoM Mainnet, connected by thinner, optional dotted lines to show limited interaction.*

---

### **Section 4: HyperQube_Z - The Flagship HyperQube**

* **Description:** **HyperQube_Z** is the **flagship HyperQube extension chain**, maintained by HC1. It acts as the testing ground for developing and refining the HC1 tooling stack and serves as a betanet for the NoM mainnet.
  * **Purpose:** Provides a safe, collaborative environment for testing new contracts, scalability solutions, and decentralized applications.
  * **Role in Ecosystem:** Acts as a template for other HyperQubes, showcasing how HC1 tooling can be leveraged for successful chain launches and upgrades.
* **Features:**
  * Fully maintained by HC1.
  * Directly connected to the NoM Mainnet for iterative improvements.
  * Allows community participation and transparent governance.

* ***Visual:** Highlight a distinct cube labeled "HyperQube_Z," positioned closest to the NoM Mainnet, with bold lines connecting it, emphasizing its flagship role.*

Idea 3 could be how each Work Package is structured + stages from concept to product (SDLC)?

-------------------------

SultanOfStaking | 2024-11-18 01:55:42 UTC | #12

I think we have to be careful to not brand NoM Mainnet as siloed / slow / etc. when making comparisons

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-11-18 14:53:37 UTC | #13

Use terms like "stable" "secure" "robust"

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-11-18 15:33:43 UTC | #14

I'll read over this and provide some feedback.

georgezgeorgez | 2024-12-03 22:39:46 UTC | #19

Reviewing this now

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-12-03 23:17:42 UTC | #20

@sugoibtc I think you have the gist of it.
 
Here's what I think would be a good set:

INFOGRAPHIC 1: Relationship between Zenon and Hyperqube
Key points:
* hyperqube network is NOT replacing zenon
* hyperqube is an extension chain ecosystem for Zenon to add scalability and features to the ecosystem
* The initiative is led by HyperCore One but governance directly relies on the Pillars
* The goal will be a LaunchKit where any community can launch their own extension chain

INFOGRAPHIC 2: HyperQube community working together
Key points:
* HyperQube incubator helps projects to develop and mature for AZ viability
* Comprehensive work packages cover all necessary aspects of development including testing, docs, and awareness. This results in high quality delivery
* Incentives are set by pillar votes in advance to give contributors confidence in doing their work and applying for AZ
* Contributors can get paid out even for small contributions
* Incubator is currently done manually, but will be implemented as a zApp in the future

INFOGRAPHIC 3: hyperqube_z production betanet
* hyperqube_z, first/flagship hyperqube which uses the go-zenon architecture
* Improvements and experiments can be done on hyperqube_z first to validate them
* Hyperqube_z, low cost for bad upgrade. Mainnet high cost for bad upgrade
* The best and proven changes will then be ported to mainnet
( would probably be good to show the progression. DEVNET -> HYPERQUBE -> MAINNET )

-------------------------

Elregel | 2024-12-09 20:24:40 UTC | #21

Hi guys, here the first draft of this part. LMK what you think. It's definitely not the final version. 
![hype q1|690x388](upload://aws9TdctcRrTYzdGywWOgBSRDKl.jpeg)

georgezgeorgez | 2024-12-09 20:32:23 UTC | #22

Regarding mainnet's "Solo Work or Closed Collaboration"
This is not something inherent to mainnet itself.
It's a problem we are trying to solve.
On mainnet, we want to have open collaboration too. But we don't have the ecosystem for it yet.
Hyperqube is hoping to create a collaborative model that it will use to develop extension chains which once proven out, can also apply to mainnet.

So I think my feedback would be to put Mainnet on the left and Hyperqube_z on the right.
And to have it presented as Challenges and Solutions.

For example

Challenges on mainnet:
* So far we've seen a considerable amount of closed collaboration
  * contributors might be working on the wrong things, and not get that feedback in time
  * contributors might have unrealistic expectations regarding compensation, and not get that feedback in time
  * it's hard to review

Solutions with Hyperqube
* etc etc

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-12-09 20:35:42 UTC | #23

I guess just a feedback on layout as well.
Might be good to move "workflow comparison" or whatever the title is up top
so that there's not so much negative space in between the content

but as long as it looks good and @sugoibtc signs off on it
good with me

-------------------------

sugoibtc | 2024-12-09 20:39:09 UTC | #24

Nice start @Elregel. My feedback point would be less = more.

Let the visuals do the work. If you add text, try to keep it at bulletpoints. It should be clear and short.

Also I would put the "Workflow comparison" at the top. Put the two blocks next to each-other to highlight the challenges on mainnet vs opportunities on HQ

-------------------------

georgezgeorgez | 2024-12-09 20:46:51 UTC | #25

I guess to keep it short.

On mainnet
"No collaborative framework yet"

What would be an example of non-hyperqube?

-------------------------

sugoibtc | 2024-12-18 22:30:09 UTC | #28

> What would be an example of non-hyperqube?

Supernova could be seen as a non-hyperqube. @Elregel this might be good to put as example.

I think it's a nice start! I like how you used the galaxy/rings to visualize the difference. Imo the key message should be what the differences are within the NoM/Hyperqube ecosystem and why people would want to deploy through Hyperqube.

The fonts might be too small, we can work on the text.

@georgezgeorgez any thoughts/feedback?
