# Introduction to Nano

Launched in 2015 as RaiBlocks, Nano distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency space with a new approach to digital transactions. Creator Colin LeMahieu envisioned a solution to the pressing issues of scalability, transaction fees, and energy consumption that “plagued” traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin at the time. Nano’s block-lattice structure, which allows each account to maintain its own blockchain, facilitates instant transactions without fees, positioned Nano as a groundbreaking force in digital payments at the time.

## Celebrating Nano’s Innovation and Design Decisions

Nano, with its introduction of the Block Lattice architecture, paved the way for new advancements in digital currency technology. This innovative approach allows each account to operate its own blockchain, facilitating instant transactions and scalability unseen in traditional blockchain models when launched. The Block Lattice is the cornerstone of Nano’s ability to provide fast and feeless transactions, underscoring the platform’s commitment to efficiency and user experience.

### Nano's Consensus Mechanism

At the heart of Nano’s operation is the Open Representative Voting (ORV) consensus mechanism, a unique design instrumental in network security. Unlike traditional consensus models that heavily rely on mining or staking, ORV leverages the voting power of representative nodes selected by account holders. This approach not only democratizes the process of transaction verification but also reduces energy consumption, aligning with Nano’s vision of an eco-friendly cryptocurrency.

While Nano’s ORV consensus provides robust security and network consensus, it presents some interesting obstacles. Representative nodes are not directly incentivized which poses interesting challenges for long-term network participation and security.

### Nano’s Anti-Spam is Tested
Nano’s enduring battle with spam attacks tests the network’s resilience, reflecting the ongoing need for adaptable anti-spam mechanisms. While most crypto projects deal with spam by attaching a fee to transactions, Nano pioneered a feeless design. They recently deployed a bucket design to prevent spam which is currently under attack with mixed results.

## Use Cases
Nano’s dedicated focus as a medium of exchange, though a testament to its streamlined design, invites the possibility for broader functionalities to enhance its utility in a rapidly evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.

## Learning from the Lessons of Nano
Recognizing the pioneering contributions of Nano, Zenon Network leverages the block lattice architecture and introduces new design considerations to improve upon consensus design, anti-spam prevention, and broad use cases.

By exploring new solutions to incentivize node participation and enhancing network resilience against spam, Zenon Network attempts to elevate the foundational principles set forth by Nano. Moreover, Zenon extends the utility beyond mere transactions, envisioning a comprehensive ecosystem that supports a wide range of applications and services.

25% chatGPT.  I'm finding GPT is good for fine tuning, not writing from scratch.
