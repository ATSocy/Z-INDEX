On the topic of increasing pillar engagement and NoM's capacity for collective action:

I'm dreaming of a NoM dashboard.

Rather than logging into syrius, syncing, checking 3-4 tabs, scrolling 600 telegram messages, two forums, discord, orchestrator status, etc

If users / pillars could customize their own web app dashboard to show the status of the bridge, their infra, AZ proposals that need voting, an offchain dm system for verified users...

Maybe something like this, but more elaborate? https://www.dapptest.xyz/

Zenonhub.io offers a lot already though, I remember @digitalSloth being very open to improve his website for the community.

This is a cool idea, Im working on some major updates for Zenon Hub but after those are released I could look at making a configurable home page with customisable widgets

check out this TC dashboard for ideas.  I don't think what they track is what is being proposed here.  But I always liked the look and feel of this site.
