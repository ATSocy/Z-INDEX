We are discussing moving the Matter Most kanban boards to Github.  If we do that:

1) Should we move to the official repo /zenon-network?  If we do that Kaine will need to make them public after I create them.
2) Should we create the kanban boards under each repo or at the Org level? For example, should `go-zenon` items live under the `go-zenon` repo or should it live under the `zenon-network` org?

The more activity we can show on the official repo the better.
