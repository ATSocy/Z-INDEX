@jovi we are setting up the Supernova L2 explorer (novascan.io).  We are hosting the explorer with a 3rd party and I have the ability to add a new logo and style the page.

Would you be willing to provide a logo?

https://novascan.io/overview

Also, do you have some recommendations for these color options?

We are on the $150/mo plan.  In order to white label (style) the plan we need to upgrade to $500/mo.  Not sure we want to do that yet.  So maybe @jovi we should hold off on the style recommendations.  I can't add a logo either in the $150/mo plan.

Bummer.  But I do think we need a logo for supernova.  I'm sure we will need it in other spots.
