Does anyone have a strong opinion about hosting the bridge webapp at bridge.zenon.network?

This would require the domain admin to insert a cname into zenon.network.  We could accomplish this (or not) by requiring interstellar to approve the PR with a note on what cname to insert.  If he approves the PR he will know he needs to add the cname.  If he does not approve it, the bridge will never go live.  

Any thoughts?

No strong opinion, but I think the domain name bridge.zenon.network is more suitable. At the same time, it is a good exercise to see if changes like these can be implemented.

Don't forget the testnet version of the bridge.
