How many times did Kaine tell us he wants to keep the L1 simple: settlement only?

Meanwhile, Ethereum is talking about keeping scaling solutions off the L1 so it can focus on settlement and consensus.  Leave the scaling solutions to higher levels.

Eferium's blob space summarises that Vitalik is a grift expert

why?  This idea of blob space seems logical to me.  Why scale the L1 and compete with faster L2s?

he jst misdirected all the devs to build on eth, instead of L2's on btc when its the same result where eth isn't built for mass txs and it has less hash power
