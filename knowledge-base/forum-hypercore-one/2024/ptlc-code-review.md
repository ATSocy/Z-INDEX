@georgezgeorgez has submitted a PR for PTLCs.  George has asked the community to review the code.  

https://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon/pull/13

George has provided a background resource here: https://forum.hypercore.one/t/ptlcs-the-standard/200 to learn more about PTLCs.  According to the last dev meeting, @sumamu reviewed the code but still had some questions.

@aliencoder has requested a code review meeting to ask questions.  I will use this post to help facilitate that meeting.  Stay tuned.
