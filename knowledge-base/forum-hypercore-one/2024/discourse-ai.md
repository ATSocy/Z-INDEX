I would like to experiment w/ AI on Discourse.  Looks like I'll need a separate machine to run the services to support this.  Apparently this can take a GPU and some ram.  I might start by installing the plugin https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-ai/259214

I'll research this a little more and report back.
