I'm not sure how stable this status page will be.  It's running for now.

This plays an important role in maintaining the bridge online. Even now we're at 100%, which wasn't the case before @0x3639 created the status page.

A Telegram/Twitter bot that announces when an orchestrator is down would be an equally useful addition.

For Discord, @mehowz has already created a channel dedicated to the orchestrator operators.

I will keep extending this.  @aliencoder gave me some feedback too.  Including adding an orchestrator version number.

@sumamu is there a way to query that for each orchestrator?  I didn't think so.
