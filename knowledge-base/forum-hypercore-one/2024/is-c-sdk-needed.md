Hello everyone,

I was hanging out in the forum and saw the C++ SDK is 20%. Is there a requirement for it? I have some friends who wants to develop it but I don't know if it's required or not.

Waiting for your responses.

No special requirements as far as I know. Feature parity with the Dart SDK (most developed one) would be nice.

If you meant if the network needs it, I think we are aiming for supporting as many of the mainstream languages as possible, so I would say thats a pending task that needs to be completed, yeah.
