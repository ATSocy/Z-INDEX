I've identified some key areas for updating our website. Below are actionable tasks for each section to maintain our site's functionality and keep users up-to-date. Let's discuss here and suggest any additional items I might have missed.

## Social Proof Section
- Remove the non-functional BSC News link

## Roadmap Section
- Compile a list of upcoming milestones and integrate them into the roadmap display. 

## Compare with Other Networks Section
1. Select networks we want to compare against
2. Identify and list key metrics for comparison
3. Design a responsive comparison table that aligns with our site's aesthetics

## Provide Liquidity Section
- Remove "soon" label and add a link to the add liquidity section of the bridge website 

## Bug Bounties
1. Draft a proposal for a structured bug bounty program and outline the budget and scope
2. Remove soon label

## Built by Aliens Section
1. Add Hypercore.one to the slider.
2. Consider redesigning the slider for mobile view, it's looking a bit crowded.
3. Design a dedicated ecosystem page to be able to feature more additions in the future.

There should also be something like a feed or ticker showing code merge/protocol updates/releases etc. This could be used as a lower effort alternative or complementary timeline display to @0x3639 's monthly dev updates
